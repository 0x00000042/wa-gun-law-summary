The 2022 legislative session is almost here, and I like to post a FAQ during session to help those who may not be familiar with the process to learn how things work. Keep in mind this is less about any particular bills and more about the legislative process itself. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments. I'll be glad to help where I can, and I'm sure others will be too. Together we can better educate ourselves and understand how and when to get involved. 

**When does session start?**

Monday, January 10th, 2022.

**When does session end?**

March 10th, 2022.

**What are the important legislative deadlines this year?**

Other than the start and end of session which are determined by the State Constitution, we don't know yet. The various internal deadlines are negotiated between the House and Senate at the start of session every year and these have not yet been posted. 

Once they come to agreement, these deadlines will be posted on the legislative [session cutoff calendar](http://leg.wa.gov/legislature/Pages/cutoff.aspx) and I'll update this post. Note this link currently points to last year's calendar still.

**What is a committee?**

A committee is a smaller group formed of members of either the House or the Senate whose job is to review bills of particular topics, hold public hearings, recommend changes to the bills, and, ultimately, to recommend passing or rejecting the bill to their respective chambers at large. The point of this is that there are far too many bills to have the entire chamber focus on every single bill. This method allows for simultaneous reviews by different groups with different areas of expertise and interest.

**Which committees are particularly important?**

By far the most important committees when it comes to firearm rights are the House [Civil Rights & Judiciary Committee](https://leg.wa.gov/House/Committees/CRJ/Pages/default.aspx) and the Senate [Law & Justice Committee](https://leg.wa.gov/Senate/Committees/LAW/Pages/default.aspx). These two committees are assigned most, if not all, firearms related bills for review and public feedback.

**When does a passed bill take effect?**

For 2022: June 8th unless otherwise specified in the bill.

Per the [State Constitution](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/WAConstitution.aspx), Article 7, no bill may take effect less than 90 days from the end of session in which it passed unless the bill is deemed "*necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, support of the state government and its existing public institutions*", though it can take effect later than 90 days too. 

**How does a bill become law?**

The legislature maintains a [summary](http://leg.wa.gov/legislature/Pages/Bill2Law.aspx) and a [detailed overview](http://leg.wa.gov/legislature/Pages/Overview.aspx) of the process, but at its most basic form a bill becomes a law when it is passed by a simple majority in each chamber of the legislature and then signed by the governor. If the governor vetoes, the legislature can override that by passing the bill with a two-thirds majority in each chamber. 

**What is the current balance of power in the legislature?**

The Democrats have a majority in both chambers as follows:  

Senate: 29-19 (+1 vacancy after a recent death) 
House: 57-41

**How many votes are needed in each chamber to pass a bill?**

Senate: 25 to pass, 33 to override a veto  
House: 50 to pass, 66 to override a veto

**How do I find out who my legislators are?**

Visit the legislature's [find my district page](https://app.leg.wa.gov/DistrictFinder/) and either enter your residential address to have it find your district automatically or use the map to find where you live and see which district encompasses it. Once you find your district it will then list the names of your legislators with links to their profile summary.

Alternatively, if you know your district number already, you can visit the list of [Senators](http://leg.wa.gov/Senate/Senators/Pages/default.aspx) and [Representatives](http://leg.wa.gov/house/representatives/Pages/default.aspx) directly and filter by district number.

**How do I contact my legislators?**

The [Senate](http://leg.wa.gov/Senate/Senators/Pages/default.aspx) and [House](http://leg.wa.gov/house/representatives/Pages/default.aspx) membership lists provide contact info for each legislator including their address in their home district, their address for their Olympia office, their phone number, a link to a form to send an email, and a link to their individual web page.

Alternatively, you can comment directly on any bill from a link found on the right hand side of any bill's information page titled *Comment on this bill*.

**What is the likelihood that new gun control bills will pass?**

It's difficult to predict at this time despite the Democratic majority because we don't have enough information yet. Session has yet to start so we haven't seen all of the bills filed yet, let alone how much support they may or may not have. Also, the legislature has COVID and budget shortfall priorities to take care of. We will have a better idea in a couple weeks once bills are introduced and start filtering out of committees.

**Where do I find a list of firearms related bills?**

You can search pending bills by any subject [here](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/billsbytopic/default.aspx), but here is a direct link to the [list of firearms bills](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/billsbytopic/Results.aspx?subject=FIREARMS). Beware that new bills make take a few days to show up on this list after introduction as it takes time to get them uploaded and properly categorized.

**How do I view information about a bill?**

From the [list of firearms bills](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/billsbytopic/Results.aspx?subject=FIREARMS) each bill is listed as a link which will take you to the bill's page. Alternatively, go to the [bill finder](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/) page and search for it there.

**How do I track the status of a particular bill?**

 On the bill's information page, its status changes will be listed under the *Bill History* section in chronological order with the date the change occurred.

**How do I find a summary of the effects of a bill?**

On the bill's information page there is a section at the bottom called *Available Documents*. Within that section the *Bill Digest* document summarizes the effects of a bill. Be cautious with these, as they are general and abstract summaries and lack detail and nuance. I recommend using the digest only to get a vague idea of what a bill is about, and highly encourage you to read the full text to see the complete picture.

**How do I find the full text of a bill?**

Under the *Available Documents* section of a bill's information page, all drafts of the full text will be listed below the heading *Bill Documents* starting with the first draft titled *Original Bill*. As bills are amended or substituted, approved, and signed into law additional drafts will become available.

**How do I read the full text of a bill?**

This has been a source of lots of confusion over the years (including on the I-1639 petition forms because they didn't format it properly). The text of each bill will be formatted to highlight changes as follows:

Completely new sections of law will begin with a heading that reads *NEW SECTION* and is underlined. All of the text following that up until the next section is brand new and will be formatted in plain text.

Amended sections of existing law will begin with a statement like "Sec. X. RCW Y and Z are each amended to read as follows" and the text of that section will be formatted as follows:

> Existing text - plain  
> Added text - **underlined and bolded**  (can't underline on reddit)  
> Removed text - ~~strikethrough~~

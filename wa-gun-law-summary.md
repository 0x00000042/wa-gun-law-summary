## What's New For 2022

Three new firearms laws passed this year. All three primarily take effect July 1, 2022, but there are some parts that won't take effect until later.

* **[SB 5078](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5078&Year=2021&Initiative=false)** - Prohibits the sale, importation, distribution, and manufacturing of magazines with capacities over 10 rounds starting July 1st, 2022. Does not impact possession or use of magazines acquired before that date. See [this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WAGuns/comments/srb7td/large_capacity_magazines_and_you_a_sb_5078_faq/) for more.
* **[HB 1705](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1705&Initiative=false&Year=2021)** - Prohibits making unserialized firearms and selling, transferring, and receiving unserialized partially complete frames and receivers starting July 1st, 2022. Requires any unserialized firearms or partially complete frames and receivers owned before July 1st to be serialized via an FFL before March 10th, 2023. See [this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WAGuns/comments/t7roof/ghost_guns_for_corporeal_people_an_hb_1705_faq/) for more.
* **[HB 1630](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1630&Initiative=false&Year=2021)** - Prohibits possession of firearms and other weapons at school board meetings, local government meetings, and elections-related areas.

## Disclaimers

**Are you a lawyer?**

No.

**Can you provide legal advice?**

No. These are my personal opinions only. I suggest you read the referenced sources yourself and come to your own understanding. If you have any specific questions regarding personal situations, ask an actual lawyer.

**Will you defend me in court?**

No.

## General Information

**Does the State Constitution protect the right to keep and bear arms?**

Yes. See Article I, Section 24 of the [State Constitution](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/WAConstitution.aspx).

**Where can I find state laws on firearms?**

Most state firearm laws are in RCW chapter [9.41](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41), though some exist elsewhere like [77.15.460](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.15.460) which regulates possession of a loaded rifle or shotgun in a vehicle, and WAC [332-52-145](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=332-52-145) which regulates target shooting on public lands managed by the Department of Natural Resources.

**Where can I find state firearm definitions?**

Most definitions related to firearm laws are contained in RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010).

**Where can I find answers to common firearm questions?**

The Attorney General's Office [firearms FAQ](https://www.atg.wa.gov/firearms-faq) and the Department of Licensing's [firearms information](https://www.dol.wa.gov/business/firearms/index.html).

## State Preemption

**Does Washington have state preemption of firearms laws?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.290](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.290) establishes state preemption and prevents local governments from enacting laws that are more restrictive than or inconsistent with state law, except as specifically authorized.

**Can cities or counties implement their own restrictions on firearms?**

State preemption only allows this in two circumstances provided in RCW [9.41.300](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.300) (2): (a) cities and counties may restrict the discharge of firearms within their boundaries, but exempts self-defense uses, and (b) cities and counties may restrict possession of firearms in stadiums and convention centers operated by the local government, but exempts CPL holders.

## NFA Firearms

**Are short barreled rifles (SBRs) legal?**

Yes, provided the SBR is in compliance with federal law. See RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) (2).

**Are short barreled shotguns (SBSs) legal?**

No. SBSs are prohibited outright in RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) (1), unless acquired before July 1, 1994 as provided in (4).

**Are machine guns legal?**

No. MGs are prohibited outright in RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) (1), unless acquired before July 1, 1994 as provided in (4).

**Are *Any Other Weapons* (AOWs) legal?**

Generally yes. State law doesn't define these and doesn't otherwise prohibit them. Of course you must otherwise comply with federal NFA requirements.

**Are destructive devices legal?**

State law doesn't define these and doesn't otherwise prohibit them. However, explosives are regulated by the [State Explosives Act](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.74).

**Are suppressors legal?**

Yes, provided the suppressor is in compliance with federal law. See RCW [9.41.250](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.250) (1)(c).

## Bump Stocks

**Are bump-stocks legal?**

No. Bump-stocks are prohibited outright in RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.220) (1).

## Magazines

**Are standard capacity magazines legal?**

After July 1 it will no longer be legal to sell, distribute, import, or manufacture "large capacity magazines". However, it will remain legal to possess and use the ones you already have.

**What is a "large capacity magazine"?**

Put simply, any magazine capable of holding more than ten rounds.

**Are there any exceptions?**

Yes. The definition of "large capacity magazine" in the [full text](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5078-S.PL.pdf) of the bill excludes magazines that have been permanently altered to a capacity of 10 or less, any 22-caliber tube magazine, and any tube magazine in a lever-action firearm.

**Can I leave the state and return with my "large capacity magazine"?**

Yes. The definition of *import* in the [full text](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5078-S.PL.pdf) excludes those who leave the state and return with the same magazine.

**Where can I find more details about the "large capacity magazine" restrictions?**

See [this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WAGuns/comments/srb7td/large_capacity_magazines_and_you_a_sb_5078_faq/).

## Assault Weapons

**Does Washington have an *assault weapon* law?**

Not exactly. The state defined and regulates *semiautomatic assault rifles* but doesn't have a California or New York style *assault weapon* ban.

**What is a *semiautomatic assault rifle*?**

A semiautomatic rifle, that's it. See RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (26).

**Are there any exceptions?**

Only firearms rendered inoperable, antique firearms, and manually operated firearms. Notably, there is no exception for caliber or magazine types, so even a tube-fed .22LR semiautomatic rifle meets the definition.

**Are *semiautomatic assault rifles* legal?**

Yes. There are some restrictions on purchase and possession by people under 21 and there are some extra purchasing steps for those over 21, but they are otherwise legal. More on these regulations below in the *Purchasing* and *Possession Restrictions by Age* sections.

## Self-Made Firearms

**Are self-made firearms legal?**

Yes, but starting July 1, 2022 it will be illegal to make an *untraceable firearm* so all self-made guns going forward must be serialized in advance. Then, starting March 10, 2023 it will be illegal to possess any *untraceable firearm* so any existing self-made guns made after July 1, 2019 must be serialized before then.

**What is an *untraceable firearm*?**

Generally, any firearm made after July 1, 2019 that was not serialized by a licensed dealer, importer, or manufacturer. See RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (34).

**Are 80% receivers and frames considered *untraceable firearms*?**

In my opinion, no. I do not believe lowers, frames, or receivers are *firearms* under state definition RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (11) since they are not yet capable of firing a projectile. Therefore they can not yet be *untraceable firearms* either.

**Can vendors ship 80% lowers to Washington residents?**

Yes, but after July 1, 80% lowers and frames must be serialized by a licensed dealer, importer, or manufacturer prior to sale and receipt, unless the purchaser is a licensed dealer, importer, or manufacturer who will be serializing it themselves prior to sale.

In addition, some vendors choose not to anyway due to lack of clarity around how to comply with RCW [9.41.325](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.325) which prohibits helping a prohibited person acquire or make an *undetectable firearm* or *untraceable firearm*.

## Polymer Lowers and Frames

**Are polymer lowers and frames legal?**

Yes. While state law bans *undetectable firearms* outright, I do not believe lowers, frames, or receivers on their own are *firearms* at all under state definition RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (11). And if they aren't yet *firearms*, they cannot be *undetectable firearms* either.

However, a complete gun made from such a lower, frame, or receiver could become subject to those laws depending on how it's constructed. This is usually naturally avoided by having enough metal bits in the barrel, bolt, and internals to become "detectable".

**What is an *undetectable firearm*?**

Any *firearm* that is not as detectable as a specific example steel alloy by a metal detector or any firearm where the major components are not identifiable as such in an x-ray machine. See RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (32) for the complete definition.

**Are *undetectable firearms* legal?**

No, they are prohibited outright by RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) (1). But this basically mirrors federal law in [18 U.S. Code ยงโฏ922 (p)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922#p) which has existed since the 1980s so it is very unlikely you have one of these.

## Purchasing

**Is there a waiting period when purchasing firearms?**

For any firearm other than a *semiautomatic assault rifle*, RCW [9.41.092](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.092) (1) requires a dealer to wait until either approval of all required background checks or ten business days have elapsed, whichever happens first, before delivering the firearm. For a *semiautomatic assault rifle*, (2) requires a dealer to wait until ten business days have elapsed even if background checks are approved earlier.

**Even for CPL holders?**

Yes. The CPL waiver to the state background check was repealed in 2019 due to FBI policy changes. On paper it will return July 1, but this is unlikely to happen in practice. See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/WA_guns/comments/uj7ni0/are_cpl_ever_gonna_exempt_me_from_background/) for more on why.

**Can someone under 21 purchase a pistol or semiautomatic rifle?**

No. RCW [9.41.240](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.240) (1) prohibits a person under twenty-one from purchasing a *pistol* or *semiautomatic assault rifle*.

**What is the process for purchasing a semiautomatic rifle?**

* Proof of safety training completed within the last five years^1  
* A completed [firearm transfer application](https://www.dol.wa.gov/forms/652001.pdf)^2
* A background check conducted by the law enforcement agency local to the buyer^3
* An $18 fee^4
* An implied waiver of health data confidentiality^5
* Yearly background checks^6
* Mandatory ten business day wait^7

**What is the process for purchasing a pistol?**

* A completed [firearm transfer application](https://www.dol.wa.gov/forms/652001.pdf)^2
* A background check conducted by the law enforcement agency local to the buyer^3
* An implied waiver of health data confidentiality^5
* Yearly background checks^6
* Up to ten business day wait or approval, whichever occurs first^8

**What is the process for purchasing a shotgun, manual action rifle, or *other* type firearm?**

* Federal [form 4473](https://www.atf.gov/file/61446/download)
* An on-the-spot background check through the federal NICS
* Up to ten business day wait or approval, whichever occurs first^8

## Private Sales and Transfers

**Are background checks required for private sales or transfers?**

Generally, yes. RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) requires most private transfers to go through a dealer. There are some exemptions, however, listed under (4).

**Are sales to friends and relatives exempt from the background check requirements?**

No, sales are not exempt.

**Are gifts and loans to friends and relatives exempt from the background check requirements?**

*Bona fide* gifts and loans to immediate family are exempt by RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4)(a). In general, other gifts and loans are not except for the temporary situations listed in (4)(c), (d), and (g). However, because of federal interstate laws, this exemption only applies if both persons are residents of Washington.

**Is a C&R transfer exempt from the background check requirements?**

Yes. See RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4)(i).

**Does sharing guns at the range require background checks?**

No. See the exceptions in RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4)(g).

**Are there any other exemptions?**

Yes, see RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4) for the complete list of exemptions.

## Frames and Receivers

**Is a background check required when selling a lower, frame, or receiver?**

In my opinion, no. I do not believe a lower, frame, or receiver meets the definition of a *firearm* under state definition RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (11) and is therefore not subject to state *firearm* laws, including universal background checks. However I suggest consulting a lawyer before doing this. The distinction between federal and state law is not well understood by everyone.

**Do the *semiautomatic assault rifle* provisions of I-1639 apply to AR-15 lower receivers?**

No. A lower does not meet the state definition of a *rifle* or *semiautomatic assault rifle* in RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (23) and (26).

**Do the state requirements on *pistol* transfers apply to pistol frames?**

No. A frame does not meet the state definition of a *pistol* in RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (22).

**Is an AR-15 lower receiver with attached stock considered a *rifle*?**

No. The ATF has specified that a lower is not a rifle until assembled with a barreled action. See [this article](https://www.typicalshooter.com/atf-putting-a-stock-on-an-ar-15-lower-does-not-make-it-a-rifle/) for more.

**Are upper receivers considered *firearms* subject to background check and transfer regulations?**

No. Upper receivers are unregulated by both federal and state law and may be shipped directly to your door.

**Aren't *frames and receivers* going to be subject to the state background check process similar to pistols soon?**

Yes. Starting 30 days after the state centralized system becomes available a dealer will be required to transfer a federally-defined *firearm frame or receiver* through the new state system in a manner similar to *pistols*.

## Curio & Relics

**Is a Curio & Relic purchase exempt from universal background checks?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4)(i) exempts transfers of C&R firearms to someone who holds a valid C&R license.

**Is a C&R-eligible semiautomatic rifle subject to the *semiautomatic assault rifle* provisions of I-1639**?

This is a complicated question with no definite answer. See [this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/WA_guns/comments/ggq7zo/2020_wa_gun_law_faq_soliciting_questions/fq3x2wk/) for more discussion.
**Can a C&R holder purchase a C&R-eligible *semiautomatic assault rifle* from a dealer and walk away with it the same day?**

I don't have an official answer, but in my opinion no. See [this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/WA_guns/comments/ggq7zo/2020_wa_gun_law_faq_soliciting_questions/fq3x2wk/) for more discussion.

## Residency

**What counts as residency for gun purchases?**

State law doesn't address this, but federal law considers the buyer a resident of whichever state they are currently residing in. Active-duty military members are considered a resident of whichever state their permanent duty station is located in, and college students are considered a resident of the state where they live and attend school during the school year, and of their home state when returning home for breaks. See [this ATF FAQ](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/what-constitutes-residency-state) for more information. Keep in mind this is different than residency for other purposes like taxation or voting.

## Out-of-state Purchases

**Can a Washington resident purchase guns over the internet from vendors in other states?**

Yes, however the gun must be delivered to a dealer in Washington first.

**Can a Washington resident purchase guns in person in other states?**

For rifles and shotguns, yes. Both RCW [9.41.122](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.122) and federal law allow the purchase a rifle or shotgun in another state. All other guns may only be received in the buyer's state of residence.

**Can a Washington resident purchase a *semiautomatic assault rifle* in another state**?

Unknown. Federal law allows a resident of one state to purchase a rifle or shotgun from a dealer in another state provided the sale complies with the "legal conditions of sale" of both states. But it is not clear if the "conditions of sale" means I-1639's provisions inhibit out-of-state purchases.

## Purchases by Out-of-state Residents

**Can a resident of another state purchase guns in this state?**

Yes, but only shotguns or manual action rifles. RCW [9.41.124](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.124) specifically prohibits the sale of a *semiautomatic assault rifle* to a resident of another state, and federal law prohibits a dealer from selling any firearm other than a shotgun or a rifle to a resident of another state.

## Interstate Transfers

**How does a resident of another state legally transfer a firearm to a Washington resident?**

Federal law requires a dealer to facilitate a transfer between residents of different states. For rifles and shotguns this can be in person at a dealer in any state provided state law allows for this. For all other guns this must be through a dealer in the recipient's state.

**Is there an exemption for gifts between immediate family who reside in different states?**

No. Federal law has no exemption to interstate transfer rules for gifts, even between family members.

## State Centralized Background Check System

**Isn't the process for purchasing firearms changing soon?**

Yes. The WSP and DOL are working on a new centralized state background check system.

**When do dealers have to start using the new system?**

Thirty days after the WSP notifies dealers that the system is available. Currently the WSP estimates the system will be ready in 2024.

**What will the sale or transfer process be in the new state system?**

Dealers will contact WSP directly for all firearm transfers, there will be a fee up to $18, and a transfer application similar to what we currently have for *pistols* and *semiautomatic rifles*. The DOL will continue to keep records of *pistol* or *semiautomatic rifle* transfers, but will not retain records of any other firearm transfers.

## Annual Background Checks

**Who is subject to the annual background checks?**

RCW [9.41.139](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.139) requires the DOL and WSP to conduct annual background checks on anyone who has acquired a *pistol* or *semiautomatic assault rifle* according to the rules of RCW chapter 9.41.

**When do the annual background checks start?**

Under RCW [9.41.139](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.139) these checks should have started by July 1, 2020, but so far none have occurred. The DOL has decided to delay implementation of this until the new state centralized system is up and running.

**Does this apply to past purchases?**

We don't know. The law does not specify which records are subject to the background check process. Since the DOL has retained pistol purchase records for decades, and private pistol transfer records for about 5 years, they have the data they need to apply this retroactively if required. Even the DOL themselves don't know. In their [report](https://www.dol.wa.gov/business/firearms/docs/FirearmsEligibilityReport2020.pdf) to the legislature on feasibility and costs, they provided two estimates: one for all records made since their current system was established in 2004, and one for all records made since the provision took effect on July 1, 2019.

**What are the guidelines for being placed on that list?**

There is nothing official that I know of yet, but I assume it includes anyone who's filled out a *pistol* or *semiautomatic rifle* transfer application since those are the records retained by DOL.

**How is someone removed from the list?**

Unknown. I-1639 contained no provisions detailing if or when to take someone off the list and RCW [9.41.129](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.129) requires DOL to retain records with no provision for removing entries.

**Does having a CPL make any difference regarding whether you are subjected to the yearly background check?**

No. A CPL is completely irrelevant to the annual background checks.

## Health Information Waiver

**What is the health information waiver?**

RCW [9.41.094](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.094) provides that a signed application to purchase a *pistol* or *semiautomatic assault rifle* constitutes a waiver to release health information related to determining if the purchaser is eligible to possess firearms under state or federal law. RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.0070) (4) provides the same implied waiver for CPL applications.

**Is the health data waiver a violation of HIPAA?**

No. This waiver is not a HIPAA violation. HIPAA includes [many exemptions](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/505/what-does-the-privacy-rule-allow-covered-entities-to-disclose-to-law-enforcement-officials/index.html) where information can be released with or without your consent, including: "*to report PHI to law enforcement when required by law to do so*".

In addition, RCW [9.41.097](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.097) compels health agencies to release information relevant to firearms eligibility to law enforcement agencies and courts regardless of whether or not you have signed a waiver.

## Moving to WA

**What guns and accessories can be brought into Washington during a move?**

No machine guns, short barreled shotguns, bump-stocks, *undetectable firearms*, and, starting July 1, magazines with capacities over 10 rounds.

**Do guns needs to be registered after moving?**

No. Washington does not have an ownership registry, and there is no requirement to file any paperwork when moving with guns already possessed. We do have a *de facto* transfer registry for pistols and semiautomatic rifles, but no ownership registry.

**How does someone establish residency for gun purchases in Washington?**

By moving here. As soon as you're here with an intent to make a home you are considered a resident for gun purposes. However, you will need some kind of government-issued document with your current address to establish proof of residency to satisfy federal law for gun purchases. Any government-issued document is legal, but many dealers choose to only accept a driver's license or state ID, so be sure to apply for a new driver's license as soon as possible.

**How long does a new resident have to wait before purchasing guns in Washington?**

There is no wait. You can begin purchasing guns in Washington as a resident as soon as you have proof of residency. However, for residents who have been here less than 90 days, a dealer must wait up to 60 days before delivering a pistol instead of the normal ten business days. Though they can still deliver earlier if background checks are approved earlier. See RCW [9.41.092](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.092) for more.

## Open Carry

**Is open carry legal?**

Generally, yes, however there are some restrictions on where open carry is legal. See the *Possession Restrictions by Location* section further down.

**Is a permit required to open carry?**

No. State law does not require any permits or licenses to open carry.

**Is open carry in a vehicle legal?**

Only for *pistols* and only if you have a CPL. State law requires a CPL to possess any loaded *pistol* inside a vehicle, regardless of whether it is openly carried on your person or not. Long guns must be unloaded while inside a vehicle.

## Concealed Carry

**Is concealed carry legal?**

For a pistol, yes, though you generally need a Concealed Pistol License. See RCW [9.41.050](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050) for more info and RCW [9.41.060](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060) for the list of exceptions.

**Is a CPL required to carry concealed at home?**

No. RCW [9.41.050](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050) specifically exempts concealed carry in a person's *"place of abode or fixed place of business"*.

**Is a CPL required to carry concealed while engaged in outdoor activities?**

No. RCW [9.41.060](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060) (8) provides an exemption to the CPL requirement when a person is lawfully engaged in outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, or hiking.

## Concealed Pistol License

**When is a CPL required?**

 Except in your home or place of business and as otherwise excepted, a CPL is required to carry a pistol (whether loaded or not) concealed on your person. See RCW [9.41.050](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050) for more information and RCW [9.41.060](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060) for a list of exceptions.

**What is the process for obtaining a CPL?**

Generally, obtaining a CPL requires filling out an application, providing fingerprints, and paying a fee of $36 plus whatever the fingerprinting costs. See also RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) for the full CPL requirements and [this DOL information page](https://www.dol.wa.gov/business/firearms/faconcealreq.html) for a summary.

**How long does it take to get a CPL?**

By law the issuing authority must issue a CPL within 30 days, unless the applicant hasn't been a resident of the state for at least 90 days or doesn't have a state provided ID, in which case the issuing authority has 60 days to issue. See RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) (1).

**Is Washington a shall-issue state?**

Yes. An issuing authority must issue a CPL unless the applicant is prohibited by state or federal law from possessing firearms. See RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) (1).

**Who is eligible for a CPL?**

Anyone who is at least 21 years old and does not meet any of the disqualifiers in RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) (1)(a-g).

**Are non-residents eligible for a CPL?**

Yes. There is no distinction between a resident and non-resident CPL other than where a person applies and how long the issuing authority has to make a decision. Unless the person is prohibited, the issuing authority must issue the CPL within 60 days to a new resident or non-resident.

**Where do I apply for a CPL?**

Residents of any city or town may apply at either the police department of the municipality where they reside or the sheriff of the county where they reside. Residents of unincorporated counties may apply at the sheriff of the county where they reside. Non-residents may apply at any police department or sheriff office in the state. See RCW [9.41.070](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) (13).

**How is COVID affecting CPLs?**

Unfortunately, many police and sheriff agencies have months-long backups for new original CPLs due to the fingerprinting requirements. Due to COVID, many agencies have severely limited the number of fingerprinting appointments available in a given week and some refuse to accept third-party fingerprinting services.

## Possession in Vehicles

**Is carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle legal?**

A person with a valid CPL may possess a loaded pistol in a vehicle. Otherwise placing or possessing a loaded pistol in any vehicle is illegal. See RCW [9.41.050](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050) (2).

See also RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (17) for the state definition of *loaded*, but generally this means no ammunition in the chamber, cylinder, and no loaded magazine inserted in the action. It does not include loaded magazines which are removed from the firearm.

Long guns may not be loaded in a vehicle except for hunters granted a disability designation while hunting and otherwise in compliance with hunting regulations. See RCW [77.15.460](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.15.460). Note that in this specific case loaded detachable clips or magazines may not be attached to the rifle or shotgun either.

**Does this apply to public transportation?**

In my opinion, yes. State law doesn't contain an exemption for public transportation in the laws prohibiting placing or possessing a loaded firearm in any vehicle. See RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) (2).

**Are there any exemptions?**

Yes. See the exceptions listed in RCW [9.41.060](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060).

**Does state law require separating guns and ammo in a vehicle?**

No. State law only requires that guns are not loaded in a vehicle, except for pistols with a valid CPL.

**Can an AR pistol be transported loaded in a vehicle with a valid CPL?**

In my opinion, yes, provided the firearm in question meets the definition of a *pistol* in RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (22). I do not know of any cases where this has been tested, however, and you should consult an attorney for clarification.

## Possession Restrictions by Location

**Are firearms prohibited in certain locations?**

Yes. State law prohibits possession in many locations, as specified in RCW [9.41.280](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.280), [9.41.282](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.282), [9.41.300](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.300), and [9.41.305](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.305). In addition, [HB 1630](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1630-S.SL.pdf) will add additional locations starting July 1.

**Are firearms prohibited in schools?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.280](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.280) prohibits possession of any firearm on school grounds, in school facilities, on school transportation, in other areas being used exclusively by schools (such as field trips), and, starting July 1, in any other area during a school board meeting.

*Exceptions* - CPL holders in possession of a pistol while picking up or dropping off a student; non-students at least 18 years old conducting legitimate business at the school who secure a firearm in a vehicle.

**Are firearms prohibited in day care facilities?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.282](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.282) prohibits possession of any firearm on the grounds of day care facilities.

*Exceptions* - CPL holders dropping off or picking up children; non-students at least 18 years old conducting legitimate business at the day care center who secure a firearm in a vehicle.

**Are firearms prohibited at demonstrations?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.300](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.300) (2) prohibits the open carry of a firearm or other weapon at any "permitted demonstration" or within 250 feet of such a demonstration.

*Exceptions* - (2)(e) exempts lawful concealed carry by CPL holders, but this was already implied since the prohibition only applies to open carry.

**Are firearms prohibited at the state capitol?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.305](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.305) prohibits the open carry of a firearm or other weapon on the west capitol grounds, in any building on capitol campus, in any legislative office, or in any location during a public legislative hearing or meeting.

*Exceptions* - (6) exempts lawful concealed carry by CPL holders, but this was already implied since the prohibition only applies to open carry.

**Are firearms prohibited at local government meetings?**

Starting July 1, yes. [HB 1630](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1630-S.SL.pdf) will prohibit the open carry of a firearm or other weapon in any building connected to local government meetings or in any other location while holding a local government meeting.

**Are firearms prohibited at elections-related areas?**

Starting July 1, yes. [HB 1630](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1630-S.SL.pdf) will prohibit the possession of any firearm at a ballot counting center, a voting center, a student engagement hub, county elections offices, county voter registration offices, and any other area while being used for one of these functions.

*Exceptions* - (4) exempts lawful concealed carry by CPL holders in all but ballot counting centers and locations.

**Are there any other locations where firearms are prohibited?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.300](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.300) (1) prohibits possession of any firearm in other places, including jails; court rooms; mental health facilities; bars, lounges, and cannabis shops (except for proprietor and employees); airports; and others, though common entry areas are usually exempted, while (2)(b) allows cities, towns, and counties to prohibit possession of a firearm inside a stadium or convention center operated by a city, town or county.

**Do gun free zones have force of law?**

Only for the situations mentioned above. Otherwise, no, but trespassing law still applies.

## Possession Restrictions by Age

**Can a person under 18 possess a firearm?**

Generally, no, but there are exceptions. RCW [9.41.040](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.040) (2)(a)(vi) prohibits possession of any firearm by someone under 18 except as provided in RCW [9.41.042](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.042).

**Can someone over 18 but under 21 possess a pistol?**

Yes, but with limitations. RCW [9.41.240](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.240) (2) restricts possession of a pistol by someone at least 18 but not yet 21 to their home, fixed place of business, property under their control, or in any of the situations in RCW [9.41.042](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.040), [9.41.050](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050), or [9.41.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060).

**Can someone over 18 but under 21 possess a *semiautomatic assault rifle*?**

Yes, but with limitations. RCW [9.41.240](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.240) (3) restricts possession of a *semiautomatic assault rifle* by someone at least 18 but not yet 21 to their home, fixed place of business, property under their control, or in any of the situations in RCW [9.41.042](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.040) or [9.41.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060).

## Secure Storage

**What qualifies as *secure gun storage*?**

In general, any locking box, safe, or other container should qualify. See RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (25) for the complete definition.

**Does state law require guns be stored in secure storage?**

Technically, no, but RCW [9.41.360](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.360) can provide criminal penalties if a prohibited person actually gains access to guns and actually uses them to injure, kill, threaten, intimidate, or endanger others, or to commit additional crimes. However, there are exceptions in (3) that waive liability including when the guns were stored in *secure storage* or when the guns were taken as a result of unlawful entry, provided that the owner reports the theft within 5 days of discovering it.

**Does state law require reporting stolen guns?**

Again, technically, no. However not doing so means you no longer qualify for "unlawful entry" exception to liability under RCW [9.41.360](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.360) (3).

## Using or Displaying Force

**What constitutes deadly force?**

RCW [9A.16.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.010) (2) defines deadly force.

**When is force justified?**

RCW [9A.16.020](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.020) specifies when force is justified. Parts (3) and (4) are likely the most common justifications for a private individual. Beware that (3) only allows using force to prevent or resist injury or other offenses against you when the force is no more than necessary.

**When is deadly force justified?**

RCW [9A.16.050](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.050) specifies when lethal force is justified. Please read this statute yourself and consult a lawyer if you have any questions. Lethal force is a life changing event and carries significant legal and financial risks. Beware that even if you are not criminally charged, you may still be sued in civil court which has a lower burden of proof.

**What constitutes "brandishing"?**

Washington state has no crime named *brandishing*. However, there are two statutes that criminalize actions commonly referred to as "brandishing".

RCW [9.41.230](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.230) prohibits aiming a firearm, loaded or not, at another human being and wilfully dischargeing a firearm in a public place where others might be endangered.

RCW [9.41.270](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.270) prohibits carrying, exhibiting, displaying, or drawing any deadly weapon in an intent to intimidate another or in a manner that warrants alarm for the safety of others, except in a person's home or business or in lawful defense.

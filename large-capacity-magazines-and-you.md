# "Large Capacity Magazines" and You - A SB 5078 FAQ

I've noticed a lot of confusion over the effects of [SB 5078](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?billnumber=5078&year=2021) in the past few days. Rather than continue to provide answers dispersed across all the various threads of conversation, I thought it useful to collate common questions and answers here in one place.

### Disclaimers

**Are you a lawyer?**

No.

**Can you provide legal advice?**

No.

**Will you defend me in court if I make mistakes?**

No.

### General

**Should I read the [full text](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5078-S.E.pdf) myself?**

Yes.

**What does this bill do?**

This bill cuts off future supply of "large capacity magazines" by prohibiting the manufacture, importation, distribution, and sale of "large capacity magazines".

### "Large Capacity Magazines"

**What is a "large capacity magazine"?**

Any ammunition feeding device, kit, part, or combination of parts able to accept a capacity of more than 10 rounds.

**Wait, 10 rounds?**

Yes, 10.

**But I thought it was 17?**

It was, and then it [wasn't](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/5078-S%20AMS%20LIIA%20S3477.5.pdf).

**Is my ______ considered a "large capacity magazine"?**

Probably. If it holds more than ten rounds at once, the definition is broad enough that whatever you have is probably included. The only exceptions are: (a) permanently altered magazines with capacity reduced to 10 or fewer rounds; (b) .22LR tube magazines; and (c) any tube magazine in a lever action firearm.

**Why do you keep putting quotes around "large capacity magazine"?**

Because it's a made up term whose only justification to exist is to implement this bill. An [amendment](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/5078-S%20AMS%20FORT%20S4477.1.pdf) to change the term to "regular capacity magazine" was proposed but rejected. 

### Possession

**Does this bill restrict possession of my existing "large capacity magazines"?**

No, the bill was [amended](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/5078-S%20AMS%20LIIA%20S3477.5.pdf) to no longer regulate possession whatsoever.

**Can I keep my existing "large capacity magazines"?**

Yes.

**Is there a grandfather clause?**

No. Since the bill no longer regulates possession, it no longer requires a grandfather clause.

**Do I need to take photos as proof of the "large capacity magazines" I already own?**

No. Since the bill no longer regulates possession, it no longer requires proof of possession before the effective date either.

**Can I carry my existing "large capacity magazines"?**

Yes.

**Can I use my existing "large capacity magazines" at the range?**

Yes.

**Can I use my existing "large capacity magazines" in self-defense?**

Yes.

**So then how does this impact me?**

This bill restricts your ability to repair or replace magazines if they're broken, lost, or stolen, your ability to purchase new guns in the future with their intended magazines included, and your ability to share and enjoy your hobby with your friends and family.

### Importation

**Is it legal to buy "large capacity magazines" in another state and bring them back to Washington?**

No. This would be prohibited under the importation ban.

**Could I do it anyway?**

See question 2.

**Is it legal to order "large capacity magazines" online and then ship them to Washington?**

No. This would be prohibited under the importation ban.

**Could I do it anyway?**

See question 2.

**Is it legal to take my existing "large capacity magazines" out-of-state and then return with them?**

Yes. The Senate adopted [this amendment](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/5078-S%20AMS%20WAGO%20S4446.1.pdf) to specifically address this.

**Is it legal for competitors from other states to bring "large capacity magazines" into Washington for competitions?**

No. This would be prohibited under the importation ban.

**Is it legal for someone from another state to bring "large capacity magazines" into Washington with their carry gun?**

No. This would be prohibited under the importation ban. An [amendment](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/5078-S%20AMS%20FORT%20S4493.1.pdf) to allow this for those who hold a carry permit recognized by Washington was proposed but then rejected.

**Is it legal for a member of the military to bring their privately owned "large capacity magazines" with them when reassigned to Washington?**

No. This would be prohibited under the importation ban. An [amendment](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/5078-S%20AMS%20WAGO%20S4490.1.pdf) to allow this was proposed but then rejected.

**Is it legal for out-of-state residents who move to Washington after the effective date of the bill to bring with them the "large capacity magazines" they already owned in another state prior to the effective date of this bill?**

No. This would be prohibited under the importation ban.

### Repairs

**Is it legal to repair a "large capacity magazine?**

Unknown. The bill prohibits *manufacturing* and leverages the existing definition of *manufacturing* in RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) which is defined broadly to include fabrication or construction. These terms are not further defined, but the common dictionary definition of "construction" typically includes combining or assembling parts together.

**Can I order replacement parts in the future?**

Probably not. Since the bill bans the sale of "large capacity magazines" and the definition of this term includes parts that can be used to assemble a *large capacity magazine*, it's probably illegal to order replacement parts.

### Transfers

**Is it legal to transfer "large capacity magazines" to other people?**

Probably not. While the bill doesn't explicitly prohibit *transfers*, it prohibits *distribution* which is defined broadly as giving out, providing, making available, or delivering a "large capacity magazine" to any person in this state, and it doesn't

**Even to family?**

Yes. An [amendment](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/5078-S%20AMS%20MCCU%20S4440.1.pdf) to allow transfers to family members was proposed but rejected.

**Even to CPL holders?**

Yes. An [amendment](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/5078-S%20AMS%20FORT%20S4441.1.pdf) to allow transfers when one person holds a CPL was proposed but rejected.

**Even to others at the range?**

Yes. An [amendment](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/5078-S%20AMS%20FORT%20S4444.1.pdf) to allow transfers when one person operates a shooting range was proposed but rejected.

**Even during competitions?**

Even during competitions. There is no exception given for transfers at competition.

**Even during training?**

Yes. An [amendment](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/5078-S%20AMS%20FORT%20S4442.1.pdf) to allow transfers when one person is a trainer or range safety officer was proposed but rejected.

### Sales

**Is it legal to buy "large capacity magazines" today?**

Yes, and it will remain legal up until the effective date of the bill, assuming it passes into law.

**Are sales of "large capacity magazines" to law enforcement exempt?**

Of course.

**Are sales of "large capacity magazines" to the military exempt?**

Of course.

**Will sellers ignore this law?**

No. Their livelihoods depend on remaining legal and it will be not hard to catch them doing this. In addition to criminal charges for each and every magazine sold or distributed in violation of this bill, the bill also considers distribution and sales, offering to distribute or sale, and facilitating distribution, sale, or transfers online as violations of the consumer protection act which opens them to lawsuits with significant financial penalties.

## Disclaimer

**Let me start by clarifying that I am not a lawyer nor an expert. While I'm confident overall in my interpretation of state firearms law, I cannot guarantee 100% accuracy and am not equipped nor willing to defend anyone in court.** I suggest you read the referenced sources yourself and come to your own understanding, and if you have any specific questions regarding personal situations, ask an actual lawyer.

## General Information

**Does the State Constitution protect the right to keep and bear arms?**

Yes. Article I, Section 24 of the [State Constitution](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/WAConstitution.aspx) specifies:

> **SECTION 24 RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.** The right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself, or the state, shall not be impaired, but nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize, maintain or employ an armed body of men.

**Where can I find state laws on firearms?**

Generally, in RCW chapter [9.41](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41), though some provisions exist elsewhere like [77.15.460](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.15.460) which regulates possession of a loaded rifle or shotgun in a vehicle but is in the Fish & Wildlife chapter, and WAC [332-52-145](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=332-52-145) which regulates target shooting on public lands managed by the Department of Natural Resources.

**Where can I find state firearm definitions?**

Generally, definitions related to firearm laws are contained in RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010).

## NFA Firearms

**Are short barreled rifles (SBRs) legal?**

Yes, provided the SBR is in compliance with federal law. See RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) part (2).

**Are short barreled shotguns (SBSs) legal?**

No. SBSs are prohibited outright in RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) part (1), unless acquired before July 1, 1994 as provided in part (4).

**Are machine guns legal?**

No. MGs are prohibited outright in RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) part (1), unless acquired before July 1, 1994 as provided in part (4).

**Are *Any Other Weapons* (AOWs) legal?**

Generally yes. State law doesn't define AOW and doesn't otherwise prohibit them. Of course they must otherwise comply with federal NFA requirements.

**Are destructive devices legal?**

Generally yes. State law doesn't define DD and doesn't otherwise prohibit them. Of course they must otherwise comply with federal NFA requirements.

## Bump Stocks

**Are bump-stocks legal?**

No. Bump-stocks are prohibited outright in RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.220) part (1).

## Magazines

**Are standard capacity magazines legal?**

Yes. Washington has no magazine capacity restrictions. However, legislation restricting capacity is introduced nearly every legislative session and got very close to passing earlier this year.

## *Semiautomatic Assault Rifles*

**What is a** ***semiautomatic assault rifle*****?**

Simply, any semiautomatic rifle. The full definition is located in RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (26), but the definition applies to any semiautomatic rifle except for antiques, deactivated firearms, and manually operated rifles. There is no exception for caliber or magazine types, so even a tube-fed .22LR rifle meets the definition if it's semiautomatic.

**Are there any specific rules on semiautomatic assault rifles?**

## *Untraceable Firearms*

**What is an untraceable firearm?**

Generally, any firearm made after July 1, 2019 without a serial number applied by a licensed manufacturer. See RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (34) for the complete definition.

**Are *untraceable firearms* legal?**

Yes, except when made with intent to sell. See RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) part (1)(d).

## *Undetectable Firearms*

**What is an undetectable firearm?**

Generally, any firearm that is not equivalently detectable to a specific example steel alloy by a metal detector or any firearm where the major components are not identifiable as such in an x-ray machine. See RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (32) for the complete definition.

**Are *undetectable firearms* legal?**

No, they are prohibited outright by RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) part (1). This basically mirrors federal law in [18 U.S. Code § 922 (p)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922#p).

## 80% and Polymer Lowers and Frames

**Are 80% lowers and frames legal to possess?**

Yes. However, recent legislative changes have caused some confusion and, in my opinion, some people and businesses have interpreted these incorrectly.

**How do the *untraceable firearm* and *undetectable firearm* laws affect 80% and polymer lowers?**

In my opinion, it doesn't. I do not believe lowers are *firearms* under state definition so they cannot be *undetectable firearms* or *untraceable firearms* on their own. However, a complete gun made from such a lower could meet those definitions depending on how it's constructed. See RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (11) for the complete definition of a *firearm*.

**Can vendors ship 80% lowers to Washington residents?**

Yes. However some choose not to because of RCW [9.41.325](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.325) which prohibits helping a prohibited person acquire or make an *undetectable firearm* or *untraceable firearm* and considers failure to run a background check evidence of recklessness in that regard. It should be noted that failure to run a background check is not a crime in itself here, but it is undisputable evidence of recklessness for a charge of violating this statute. As a result, some vendors have decided to avoid any potential risks by refusing to ship to our state.

## Purchasing

**Is there a waiting period when purchasing firearms?**

Yes and no. RCW [9.41.092](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.092) part (1) requires a dealer to wait until either approval of all required background checks or ten business days have elapsed, whichever happens first, before delivering any firearm other than a *semiautomatic assault rifle*.

For a *semiautomatic assault rifle*, RCW [9.41.092](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.092) part (2) requires a dealer to wait until ten business days have elapsed even if background checks are approved earlier.

**Even for CPL holders?**

Yes. The legislature passed [HB 1465](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1465&Year=2019) in 2019 which removed the waiver to the waiting periods on pistol purchases for CPL holders. Without getting too deep into the weeds, this was in response to changes in FBI process which would've created a scenario illegal under federal law unless the state made changes. That bill, however, provides that the CPL waiver will return when a state centralized background check system comes online or July 1, 2022, whichever happens first.

**Can someone under 21 purchase a pistol or semiautomatic rifle?**

No. RCW [9.41.240](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.240) part (1) prohibits a person under twenty-one from purchasing a *pistol* or *semiautomatic assault rifle*.

**What is the process for purchasing a semiautomatic rifle?**

* Proof of safety training completed within the last five years — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (2) (a)*
* A completed [firearm transfer application](https://www.dol.wa.gov/forms/652001.pdf) — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (6)*
* A background check conducted by the law enforcement agency local to the buyer — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (2) (b)*
* An $18 fee — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (7)*

**What is the process for purchasing a pistol?**

* A completed [firearm transfer application](https://www.dol.wa.gov/forms/652001.pdf) — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (6)*
* A background check conducted by the law enforcement agency local to the buyer — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (1) (a)*
* An implied waiver of health data confidentiality — *RCW [9.41.094](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.094)*

## Frames and Receivers

**How should a dealer classify AR-15 lower receivers during a transfer?**

Lowers, whether completed or stripped, should be transferred as an *other firearm* by the dealer as they do not yet meet the federal or state definitions of a *pistol* or a *rifle*.

**Is an AR-15 lower receiver with attached stock considered a *rifle*?**

No. The ATF has specified that a lower is not a rifle until assembled with a barreled action. See [this article](https://www.typicalshooter.com/atf-putting-a-stock-on-an-ar-15-lower-does-not-make-it-a-rifle/) for more.

**Do the** ***semiautomatic assault rifle*** **provisions of I-1639 apply to AR-15 lower receivers?**

No. A lower does not meet the state definition of a *rifle* or *semiautomatic assault rifle* in RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (23) and (26).

**Are upper receivers considered** ***firearms*** **subject to background check and transfer regulations?**

No. Upper receivers are unregulated by both federal and state law and may be shipped directly to your door. [See also](https://www.reddit.com/r/WA_guns/comments/ggq7zo/2020_wa_gun_law_faq_soliciting_questions/fqqig1m/).

**How should a dealer classify pistol frames during a transfer?**

Pistol frames, whether completed or stripped, should generally be transferred as an *other firearm* by the dealer as they do not yet meet the federal or state definitions of a *pistol*.

**Aren't** ***frames and receivers*** **going to be subject to the state background check process similar to pistols soon?**

Yes. The Legislature passed [HB 2555](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary/?billNumber=2555&year=2020&initiative=False) earlier this year. It will require any *firearm frame or receiver* to be transferred similarly to pistols, though the annual background check provisions will not apply. Part (2) of that bill defines *firearm frame or receiver* to mirror the federal definition. 

**When will** ***frames and receivers*** **be subject to the these changes**?

Thirty days after the state centralized system becomes available.

**What happens on July 1st with lowers and other frames or receivers?**

Currently we don't know. The FBI and the state came to an agreement last year for the FBI to continue to run background checks for *others* until July 1, 2020 to give time for the state to take over responsibility. However, the state system will not be ready by July 1 and will need to come to agreement on another extension. If no extension is granted, then dealers will have no means to legally transfer an *other* type firearm until the state system becomes available, though I find that situation unlikely.

**Do the state requirements on** ***pistol*** **transfers apply to pistol frames?**

No. A pistol frame does not meet the state definition of a *pistol* in RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (22).

## Curio & Relics

**Is a Curio & Relic purchase exempt from universal background checks?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) part (4)(i) exempts transfers of C&R firearms to someone who holds a valid C&R license. Federal law also exempts C&R transfers from the typical dealer background check process.

**Is a C&R-eligible semautomatic rifle subject to the** ***semiautomatic assault rifle*** **provisions of I-1639**?

This is a complicated question with no definite answer. In my opinion, partially. RCW [9.41.113](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4)(i) exempts C&R purchases from the background check requirements. However, RCW [9.41.090](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) requires a dealer to receive proof of training before delivering any *semiautomatic assault rifle* with no exemptions.

See [this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/WA_guns/comments/ggq7zo/2020_wa_gun_law_faq_soliciting_questions/fq3x2wk/) for more discussion on this topic.

**Can a C&R holder purchase a C&R-eligible *semiautomatic assault rifle* and walk away with it the same day?**

I don't have an official answer, but in my opinion no. RCW [9.41.092](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.092) requires the dealer to wait ten business days before delivering any semiautomatic rifle, but, importantly, the clock starts when the buyer submits a purchase application or a background check is initiated for a transfer. And since a C&R transfer is exempt from the background check provisions, I do not believe the transfer window applies.

## Health Information Waiver

**What is the health information waiver?**

RCW [9.41.094](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.094) provides that a signed application to purchase a *pistol* or *semiautomatic assault rifle* constitutes a waiver to release health information related to determining if the purchaser is eligible to possess firearms under state or federal law. RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.0070) (4) provides the same implied waiver for CPL applications.

**Is the health data waiver a violation of HIPAA?**

No. The waiver required by RCW [9.41.094](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.094) is not a HIPAA violation. HIPAA includes [many exemptions](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/505/what-does-the-privacy-rule-allow-covered-entities-to-disclose-to-law-enforcement-officials/index.html) where information can be released with or without your consent, including:

> To report PHI to law enforcement when required by law to do so...

In addition, RCW [9.41.097](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.097) compels health agencies to release information relevant to firearms eligibility to law enforcement agencies and courts regardless of whether or not you have signed a waiver.

## Residency

**What counts as residency for gun purchases?**

State law doesn't address this, but federal law considers the buyer a resident of whichever state they are currently residing in. Active-duty military members are considered a resident of whichever state their permanent duty station is located in, and college students are considered a resident of the state where they live and attend school during the school year. See [this ATF FAQ](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/what-constitutes-residency-state) for more information on residency for gun purchases.

Keep in mind this is different than residency for other purposes like taxation, voting, or in-state tuition rates. Those have different qualifications.

## Out-of-state Purchases

**Can a Washington resident purchase guns over the internet from vendors in other states?**

Yes, however the gun must be delivered to a dealer in Washington first who will then process and deliver the firearm to the purchaser according to federal and state law.

**Can a Washington resident purchase guns in other states?**

Depending on the type of gun, yes. RCW [9.41.122](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.122) allows Washington residents to purchase a rifle or shotgun in another state. Under federal law, a resident of one state may purchase a rifle or shotgun in another state provided the sale complies with the "legal conditions of sale" in both states.

**Can a Washington resident purchase a *semiautomatic assault rifle* in another state**?

As a matter of academic legal discussion, possibly, there's room for interpretation and debate about state and federal law here. However, as a matter of practice, no.

Federal law allows a resident of one state to purchase a rifle or shotgun from a dealer in another state provided the sale complies with the "legal conditions of sale" of both states. The ATF has interpreted this to preclude Washington residents from purchasing semiautomatic rifles in another state and has explicitly told FFLs in other states not to perform transfers of semiautomatic rifles to Washington residents.

## Purchases by Non-residents

**Can a resident of another state purchase guns in this state?**

Yes, but only shotguns or manual action rifles. RCW [9.41.124](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.124) specifically prohibits the sale of a *semiautomatic assault rifle* to a resident of another state, and federal law prohibits a dealer from selling any firearm other than a shotgun or a rifle to a resident of another state.

## State Centralized Background Check System

**Isn't the process for purchasing firearms changing soon?**

Yes. The legislature passed [HB 2467](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?year=2020&billnumber=2467&initiative=false) earlier this year which creates a centralized state background check run by the Washington State Patrol. Once this system is created and becomes available, dealers will no longer contact either the buyer's local law enforcement agency or the federal NICS directly. Instead, dealers will contact the new state system for all firearms.

**When do dealers have to start using the new system?**

Thirty days after the WSP notifies dealers that the system is available. We don't yet know exactly when that will be since the implementation of the system is still in its infancy. The legislature passed the requirement for the WSP to make such a system earlier this year and funded that process in the budget beginning July 1.

**What will the sale or transfer process be in the new state system?**

For semiautomatic rifles:

* Proof of safety training completed within the last five years — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (2) (a)*
* A completed [firearm transfer application](https://www.dol.wa.gov/forms/652001.pdf) — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (6)*
* A background check conducted through the new WSP system
* An $18 fee — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (7)*
* An implied waiver of health data confidentiality — *RCW [9.41.094](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.094)*
* Yearly background checks — *RCW [9.41.139](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.139)*
* Mandatory ten business day wait — *RCW [9.41.092](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.092) (2)*

For pistols:

* A completed [firearm transfer application](https://www.dol.wa.gov/forms/652001.pdf) — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (6)*
* A background check conducted through the new WSP system
* An implied waiver of health data confidentiality — *RCW [9.41.094](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.094)*
* Yearly background checks — *RCW [9.41.139](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.139)*
* Up to ten business day wait or approval, whichever occurs first — *RCW [9.41.092](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.092) (1)*
* A fee up to $18

For all other firearms:

* A completed [firearm transfer application](https://www.dol.wa.gov/forms/652001.pdf) — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (6)*
* A background check conducted through the new WSP system
* An implied waiver of health data confidentiality — *RCW [9.41.094](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.094)*
* Yearly background checks — *RCW [9.41.139](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.139)*
* Up to ten business day wait or approval, whichever occurs first — *RCW [9.41.092](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.092) (1)*
* A fee up to $18

## Annual Background Checks

**Who is subject to the annual background checks?**

RCW [9.41.139](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.139) requires the DOL and WSP to conduct annual background checks on anyone who has acquired a *pistol* or *semiautomatic assault rifle* according to the rules of chapter 9.41 of RCW.

**When do the annual background checks start?**

RCW [9.41.139](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.139) requires the DOL and WSP to start performing these checks by July 1, 2020.

**Does this apply to past purchases?**

We don't know. I-1639 did not specify which records are subject to the background check process. Since the DOL has retained pistol purchase records for decades, and private pistol transfer records for about 5 years, they have the data they need to apply this retroactively if required.

Personally I believe this should only apply to purchases made since July 1, 2019 when this provision took effect, but it doesn't explicitly say that.

**What are the guidelines for being placed on that list?**

There is nothing official that I know of yet, but I assume it includes anyone who's filled out a firearm transfer application since those are the records retrained by DOL.

**Does having a CPL make any difference regarding whether you are subjected to the yearly background check?**

No. A CPL is completely irrelevant to the annual background checks required in RCW [9.41.139](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.139).

## Private Sales and Transfers

**Are background checks required for private sales or transfers?**

Generally, yes. RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) requires most private transfers to go through a dealer who will transfer the gun to the recipient as though the dealer was selling it directly from their inventory. There are some exemptions, however, listed under part (4).

**Are sales to friends and relatives exempt from the background check requirements?**

No. Only sales of antiques or C&R sales are exempt. See RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) part (4).

**Are gifts and loans to friends and relatives exempt from the background check requirements?**

*Bona fide* gifts and loans to immediate family are exempt by RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4) (a). In general, other gifts and loans are not except for in the temporary situations listed in (4) (c), (d), and (g). However beware this only applies if both persons are residents of Washington.

**Is a C&R transfer exempt from the background check requirements?**

Yes. See RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4) (i).

**Does sharing guns at the range require background checks?**

No. By RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4) (g), there are several exceptions that could apply here, including a temporary transfer that occurs at and never leaves an organized competition, a temporary transfer that remains in the presence of the original owner, and a temporary transfer to someone under 18 for sporting purposes while that person is supervised by an adult.

**Are there any other exemptions?**

Yes. For instance, a temporary transfer between spouses or a temporary transfer to prevent suicide or other imminent death or bodily harm. See RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) part (4) for the complete list of exemptions.

**Is a background check required when selling a lower?**

In my opinion, no. I do not believe a lower meets the definition of a *firearm* under state definition RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (11). If true, this means it's not subject to state *firearm* laws, including universal background checks.

**However**, it is still safest for your legal future to transfer a lower through an FFL just as you would any other firearm and I highly advise speaking with a personal lawyer before deciding to transfer lowers without a background check. A lower is still a *firearm* under federal law, and while federal law does not require background checks for firearm transfers between residents of the same state, I would not rely on others to understand the distinction between federal and state definitions and where one applies versus the other.

## Interstate Transfers

**How does a resident of another state legally transfer a firearm to a Washington resident?**

Federal law requires a dealer to facilitate a transfer between residents of different states. Generally this requires delivering the firearm to a dealer in the recipient's state before the recipient can take possession of it. However a rifle or shotgun can be transferred by a dealer in any state provided the firearm is legal and the transfer complies with laws of both the state of residence of the recipient and the state of business of the dealer. Note that the ATF has interpreted this to prohibit a dealer in another state from transferring a semiautomatic rifle to a resident of Washington, so those must go to a dealer in Washington first in all cases.

**Is there an exemption for gifts between immediate family who reside in different states?**

No. Federal law has no exemption to interstate transfer rules for gifts, even between family members.

## Transfers to Federally Licensees

**Can I legally transfer my gun to an Oregonian or Idahoan gunsmith?**

Yes. Under federal law [18 U.S. Code § 921 (a)(11)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921) a gunsmith is considered a dealer, and under [18 U.S. Code § 922 (a)(3)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922#a)
a licensed dealer may receive a firearm from a resident of any state. 

Under federal law [18 U.S. Code § 922 (a) (2) (A)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922#a_2), a licensed dealer may return a repaired or replacement firearm to the person from whom it was received without needing to run a background check. In addition, state law RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4)(f) exempts the return of a repaired or replacement firearm from the background check requirements.

**Can an individual ship a firearm to a federal licensee?**

Yes. An unlicensed individual may ship guns directly to an FFL in any state. Shotguns or rifles may be shipped via the USPS or a contract carrier (e.g. UPS, FedEx), while handguns and other firearms may only be shipped by a contract carrier. However, each carrier will have their own policies which you'll need to check before hand, and most carriers will not accept firearms at their retail centers, only distribution centers. Finally, some dealers will not accept shipments from unlicensed persons, so be sure to check the policies of the receiving dealer before shipping.

## Moving to WA

**What guns and accessories can be brought into Washington during a move?**

The state currently only prohibits machine guns, short barreled shotguns, bump-stocks, and *undetectable firearms*. See above for more on *undetectable firearms*, but briefly this would include a complete gun that is not detctable in a metal detector or not identifiable on an x-ray machine. These have also been illegal under federal law for awhile, so you most likely do not have one.

**Do guns needs to be registered after moving?**

No. Washington does not have an ownership registry. We have a *de facto* transfer registry for pistols and semiautomatic rifles, but no ownership registry.

**Does state law require anything else to maintain legal possession after moving?**

No, other than not becoming a prohibited person. There is no paperwork or anything you need to file to keep guns you previously owned in another state after moving into Washington.

**How does someone establish residency for gun purchases in Washington?**

By moving here. As soon as you're here with an intent to make a home you are considered a resident for gun purposes. However, you will need some kind of government-issued document with your current address to establish proof of residency to satisfy federal law for gun purchases. Any government-issued document is legal, but many dealers choose to only accept a driver's license or state ID, so be sure to apply for a new driver's license as soon as possible.

**How long does a new resident have to wait before purchasing guns in Washington?**

There is no wait. You can begin purchasing guns in Washington as a resident as soon as you have proof of residency. However, beware that for residents who have been here less than 90 days, a dealer must wait up to 60 days before delivering a pistol instead of the normal ten business days. Though they can still deliver earlier if background checks are approved earlier.

## Open Carry

**Is open carry legal?**

Generally, yes. As far as I know state law makes zero mention of open carry. There are some location and age-based possession restrictions, however.

**Can cities or counties implement their own restrictions on open carry?**

No. RCW [9.41.290](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.290) establishes state preemption and prevents subdivisions of the state from enacting laws that are more restrictive than or inconsistent with state law.

## Concealed Carry

**Is concealed carry legal?**

For a pistol, yes, though you generally need a Concealed Pistol License. See RCW [9.41.050](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050) for more information.

For long guns, I'm not sure exactly. State law doesn't address this one way or the other, though federal regulation considers firearms with overall length of 26 inches or more not *concealable*. I believe this implies that long guns cannot be *concealed*, however this is an area of federal and state law that I'm not very familiar with so I could be wrong.

**Is a CPL required to carry concealed at home?**

No. RCW [9.41.050](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050) specifically exempts concealed carry in a person's *"place of abode or fixed place of business"*.

**Is a CPL required to carry concealed while engaged in outdoor activities?**

No. RCW [9.41.060](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060) part (8) provides an exemption to the CPL requirement when a person is lawfully engaged in outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, or hiking.

**Can cities or counties implement their own restrictions on concealed carry?**

No. RCW [9.41.290](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.290) establishes state preemption and prevents subdivisions of the state from enacting laws that are more restrictive than or inconsistent with state law.

## Concealed Pistol License

**What is the process for obtaining a CPL?**

Generally, obtaining a CPL requires filling out an application, providing fingerprints, and paying a fee of $36 plus whatever the fingerprinting costs.

See also RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) for the full CPL requirements and [this DOL information page](https://www.dol.wa.gov/business/firearms/ faconcealreq.html) for a summary.

**How long does it take to get a CPL?**

By law the issuing authority must issue a CPL within 30 days, except when the application hasn't been a resident of the state for at least 90 days or when the application doesn't have a state provided ID, then the issuing authority has 60 days to issue. See RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) (1).

**Is Washington a shall-issue state?**

Yes. An issuing authority must issue a CPL unless the applicant is prohibited by state or federal law from possessing firearms. See RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) (1), paragraph 2.

**Who is eligible for a CPL?**

Anyone who is at least 21 years old and not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law from possesing firearms. See RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) part (1) (a-g) for the list of disqualifying factors.

**Are non-residents eligible for a CPL?**

Yes. There is no distinction between a resident and non-resident CPL other than where a person applies and how long the issuing authority has to make a decision. Unless the person is prohibited, the issuing authority must issue the CPL within 30 days to a resident and within 60 days to a new resident or non-resident.

**Where do I apply for a CPL?**

Residents of any city or town may apply at either the police department of the municipality where they reside or the sheriff of the county where they reside. Residents of unincorporated counties may apply at the sheriff of the county where they reside. Non-residents may apply at any police department or sheriff office in the state. See RCW [9.41.070](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) part (13).

**How is COVID affecting CPLs?**

Unfortunately, most police and sheriff offices are closed right now and not accepting applications. Some are open for renewals only, but not originals since they require fingerprinting. However this is by determination of each authority, so check with your chosen police department or sheriff office for more information.

## Vehicle Transport

**Is carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle legal?**

A person with a valid CPL may possess a loaded pistol in a vehicle. Otherwise placing or possessing a loaded pistol in any vehicle is illegal. See RCW [9.41.050](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050) part (2). See RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (17) for the state defintion of *loaded*, but generally this means no ammuntion in the chamber, cylinder, or in a magazine inserted in the action. It does not include loaded magazines which are removed from the firearm.

Long guns may not be loaded in a vehicle except for hunters granted a disability designation while hunting and otherwise in compliance with hunting regulations. See RCW [77.15.460](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.15.460). Note that in this specific case loaded detachable clips or magazines may not be attached to the rifle or shotgun, either.

**Does this apply to public transportation?**

In my opinion, yes. State law doesn't contain an exemption for public transportation in the laws prohibiting placing or possesing a loaded firearm in any vehicle. See RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) part (2).

**Are there any exemptions?**

Yes. The provisions of RCW [9.41.050](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050) which require a CPL do not apply in the scenarios listed in RCW [9.41.060](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060). In particular, part (8) provides that a CPL is not needed to carry a loaded pistol on your person or in a vehicle while engaging in lawful outdoor activity or traveling to or from a legitimate outdoor recreation area.

**Does state law require separating guns and ammo in a vehicle?**

No. State law only requires that guns are not loaded in a vehicle, except for pistols with a valid CPL. In general, a gun is considered unloaded if there is no ammuntion in the action, cylinder, or fixed magazine. Detachable magazines do not need to be unloaded themselves, but they cannot be inserted into the action of the firearm and, for long guns, they cannot be attached to the firearm. See RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (17) for the general definition of *loaded* and RCW [77.15.460](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.15.460) for part (5) for when a long gun in a vehicle is considered unloaded.

**Can an AR pistol be transported loaded in a vehicle with a valid CPL?**

In my opinion, yes. Provided the firearm in question meets the definition of a *pistol* in RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (22), it should be legal to have it loaded in a vehicle with a valid CPL. I do not know of any cases where this has been tested, however, and you should consult an attorney for clarification.

## Possession Location Restrictions

**Are firearms prohibited in schools?**

Generally, yes, RCW [9.41.280](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.280) prohibits possession of any firearm on school grounds, in school facilities, in school transportation, or in other areas being used exclusively by schools. Part (3) (e) exempts CPL holders in possession of a pistol while picking up or dropping off a student. In addition, part (3) (f) exempts any person who is not a student and secures and conceals from view a firearm inside a vehicle.

**Are firearms prohibited in day care facilities?**

Effective June 11, 2020, yes. State law will prohibit possession of any firearm on the grounds of day care facilities similar to how RCW [9.41.280](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?year=2020&billnumber=5434&initiative=false) prohibits possesion on school grounds. It will also contain similar exemptions for CPL holders while dropping off or picking up children and for firearms secured and obscured within vehicles. This is the result of [SB 5434](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?year=2020&billnumber=5434&initiative=false) which passed this year but has not yet been codified in RCW.

**Are there any other locations where firearms are prohibited?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.300](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.300) part (1) prohibits possession of any firearm in other places, including jails; court rooms; mental health facilities; bars, lounges, and cannabis shops; airports; and others, though common entry areas are usually exempted. 

RCW [9.41.300](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.300) part (2) (b) allows cities, towns, and counties to prohibit possession of a firearm inside a stadium or convention center operated by a city, town or county, but exempts CPL holders in possession of a pistol.

**Do gun free zones have force of law?**

Only for the situations mentioned above. Otherwise, no, but trespassing law still applies.

## Possession Age Restrictions

**Can a person under 18 possess a firearm?**

Generally, no. RCW [9.41.040](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.040) (2) (a) (vi) prohibits possession of any firearm by someone under 18 except as provided in RCW [9.41.042](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.042). These exceptions include situations like safety courses, target shooting, competition, hunting, while on a parent or relative's private property with permission, while being supervised in an area that permits the discharge of a firearm, or in self defense in the home.

**Can someone at least 18 but not yet 21 possess a pistol?**

Yes, but with limitations. RCW [9.41.240](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.240) (2) restricts possession of a pistol by someone at least 18 but not yet 21 to their home, fixed place of business, or property under their control unless one of the exceptions in RCW [9.41.042](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.040), [9.41.050](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050), or [9.41.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060) applies. These exceptions include situations like safety courses, target shooting, competition, hunting, on a parent or relative's private property, or while engaged in a lawful outdoor activity.

**Can someone at least 18 but not yet 21 possess a *semiautomatic assault rifle*?**

Yes, but with limitations. RCW [9.41.240](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.240) (3) restricts possession of a *semiautomatic assault rifle* by someone at least 18 but not yet 21 to their home, fixed place of business, or property under their control unless one of the exceptions in RCW [9.41.042](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.040) or [9.41.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060) applies. These exceptions include situations like safety courses, target shooting, competition, hunting, on a parent or relative's private property, or while engaged in a lawful outdoor activity.

## Secure Storage

**What qualifies as *secure gun storage*?**

In general, any locking box, safe, or other container should qualify. See RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (25) for the complete definition.

**Does state law require guns be stored in secure storage?**

Technically, no. However, RCW [9.41.360](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.360) can provide criminal penalties if a prohibited person actually gains access to guns and uses them to injure, kill, threaten, intimidate, endanger others, or to commit additional crimes.

But there are exceptions provided in part (3) including when the guns were stored in *secure storage* or when the guns were taken as a result of unlawful entry, provided that the owner reports the theft within 5 days of the time they discovered it.

**Does state law require reporting stolen guns?**

Again, technically, no. However not doing so may result in criminal charges under RCW [9.41.360](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.360). Specifically, the unlawful entry exemption in (3) (d) does not apply if the stolen guns are not reported within 5 days of discovering the theft.

## Using or Displaying Foorce

**What constitutes deadly force?**

RCW [9A.16.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.010) (2) defines deadly force.

**When is force justified?**

RCW [9A.16.020](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.020) specifies when force is justified. Parts (3) and (4) are likely the most common justifications for a private individual not otherwise working law enforcement or security. Beware that while part (3) allows using force to prevent or resist injury or other offenses against you, it specifies this is only justified when the force is no more than necessary.

**When is deadly force justified?**

RCW [9A.16.050](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.050) specifies when lethal force is justified. Please read this statute yourself and consult a lawyer if you have any questions. Lethal force is a life changing event and carries significant legal and financial risks. Beware that even if you are not criminally charged, you may still be sued in civil court which has a lower burden of proof.

**What constitutes "brandishing"?**

Washington state has no crime named *brandishing*. However, there are two statutes that criminalize actions commonly referred to as "brandishing".

Under RCW [9.41.230](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.230) it is illegal to aim a firearm, loaded or not, at another human being and to wilfully discharge a firearm in a public place where others might be endangered. 

Under RCW [9.41.270](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.270), except in a person's home or business or in lawful defense, it is illegal to carry, exhibit, display, or draw any deadly weapon in an intent to intimidate another or in a manner that warrants alarm for the safety of others.

The courts have generally interpreted that "warrants alarm" has a reasonableness requirement, meaning that any reasonable person would also be alarmed. This is important as it defends against ridiculous claims. See [*State v. Maclolek* (1984)](https://law.justia.com/cases/washington/supreme-court/1984/49904-7-1.html), [*State v. Spencer* (1994)](http://courts.mrsc.org/appellate/075wnapp/075wnapp0118.htm), and [*State v. Owens* (2014)](https://law.justia.com/cases/washington/court-of-appeals-division-ii/2014/43702-3.html).

In particular, in *Spencer*, the Court had the following to say:

> [4,5] ... As the Superior Court found, the statute only prohibits the carrying or displaying of weapons when objective circumstances would warrant alarm in a reasonable person...  
> [8] ... In addition, we adopt the Superior Court's conclusion that a reasonable person standard is incorporated into the phrase "warrants alarm"...  
> "As the State points out, the Legislature's use of the word "warrants" in the statute implies that there must be a sufficient objective basis for the alarm, i.e., circumstances must be such that a reasonable person would be alarmed."

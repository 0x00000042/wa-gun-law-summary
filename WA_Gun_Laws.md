## What's New For 2021

There is only one notable firearm law change in the last year. [SB 5038](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary/?billNumber=5038&year=2021&initiative=False) restricts open carry at or near protests, on capitol campus, and at legislative meetings. More on this found in the *Open Carry* section further below.

Otherwise the content of this post is mostly the same as last year's [2020 Gun Law Summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/WA_guns/comments/h8iu42/2020_washington_gun_law_summary/), but I've made some wording and formatting changes for clarity.

## Disclaimer

**I am not a lawyer nor an expert**. While I'm confident overall in my interpretation of state firearms law, I cannot guarantee 100% accuracy. **I cannot and will not defend you in court**. I suggest you read the referenced sources yourself and come to your own understanding. If you have any specific questions regarding personal situations, ask an actual lawyer.

This information is also subject to change. I will update this as necessary as things change or more clarification is received.

Finally, due to the Reddit character limit, I have to be brief and gloss over some nuance. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments.

## General Information

**Does the State Constitution protect the right to keep and bear arms?**

Yes. See Article I, Section 24 of the [State Constitution](http://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/Pages/WAConstitution.aspx).

**Where can I find state laws on firearms?**

RCW chapter [9.41](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41) contains most firearm laws, though some provisions exist elsewhere like [77.15.460](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.15.460) which regulates possession of a loaded rifle or shotgun in a vehicle but is in the Fish & Wildlife chapter, and WAC [332-52-145](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=332-52-145) which regulates target shooting on public lands managed by the Department of Natural Resources.

**Where can I find state firearm definitions?**

Most definitions related to firearm laws are contained in RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010).

**Where can I find answers to common firearm questions?**

The Attorney General's Office maintains a [firearms FAQ](https://www.atg.wa.gov/firearms-faq) and the Department of Licensing also maintains some general [firearms information](https://www.dol.wa.gov/business/firearms/index.html).

## State Preemption

**Does Washington have state preemption of firearms laws?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.290](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.290) establishes state preemption and prevents subdivisions of the state from enacting laws that are more restrictive than or inconsistent with state law, except as specifically authorized.

**Can cities or counties implement their own restrictions on firearms?**

State preemption only allows this in two circumstances as provided in RCW [9.41.300](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.300) part (2). (2)(a) allows cities and counties to restrict the discharge of firearms within their boundaries, but exempts self-defense uses, and (2)(b) allows cities and counties to restrict possession of firearms in stadiums and convention centers operated by the local government, but exempts CPL holders.

## NFA Firearms

**Are short barreled rifles (SBRs) legal?**

Yes, provided the SBR is in compliance with federal law. See RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) part (2).

**Are short barreled shotguns (SBSs) legal?**

No. SBSs are prohibited outright in RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) part (1), unless acquired before July 1, 1994 as provided in part (4).

**Are machine guns legal?**

No. MGs are prohibited outright in RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) part (1), unless acquired before July 1, 1994 as provided in part (4).

**Are *Any Other Weapons* (AOWs) legal?**

Generally yes. State law doesn't define these and doesn't otherwise prohibit them. Of course you must otherwise comply with federal NFA requirements.

**Are destructive devices legal?**

State law doesn't define these and doesn't otherwise prohibit them. However, explosives are regulated by the [State Explosives Act](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.74).

## Bump Stocks

**Are bump-stocks legal?**

No. Bump-stocks are prohibited outright in RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.220) part (1).

## Magazines

**Are standard capacity magazines legal?**

Yes. Washington has no magazine capacity restrictions.

## Assault Weapons

**Does Washington have an *assault weapon* law?**

Not exactly. The state has defined and regulates *semiautomatic assault rifles* but doesn't have a California or New York style *assault weapons* prohibition.

**What is a *semiautomatic assault rifle*?**

Simply put, any semiautomatic rifle. See RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (26) for the exact wording, but there is no exception for caliber or magazine types, so even a tube-fed .22LR rifle meets the definition if it's also semiautomatic.

**Are *semiautomatic assault rifles* legal?**

Yes. There are some restrictions on purchase and possession by people under 21 and there are some extra purchasing steps for those over 21, but they are otherwise legal. More on these regulations below in the *Purchasing* and *Possession Restrictions by Age* sections.

## Self-Made Firearms

**Are self-made firearms legal?**

Yes. Self-made firearms qualify as *untraceable firearms*, but these are legal except when made with intent to sell. See RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) part (1)(d).

**What is an *untraceable firearm*?**

Generally, any firearm made after July 1, 2019 without a serial number applied by a licensed manufacturer. See RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (34) for the exact definition.

**Are 80% receivers and frames considered *untraceable firearms*?**

In my opinion, no. I do not believe lowers, frames, or receivers are *firearms* under state definition RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (11) since they are not yet capable of firing a projectile. Therefore they can not yet be *untraceable firearms* either.

**Can vendors ship 80% lowers to Washington residents?**

Yes. However some choose not to because of RCW [9.41.325](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.325) which prohibits helping a prohibited person acquire or make an *undetectable firearm* or *untraceable firearm* and considers failure to run a background check evidence of recklessness in that regard. While legal to sell and ship these to WA, compliance is not clearly spelled out and some vendors have chosen to not sell or ship to WA to avoid any potential risk.

## Polymer Lowers and Frames

**What is an *undetectable firearm*?**

Generally, any firearm that is not equivalently detectable to a specific example steel alloy by a metal detector or any firearm where the major components are not identifiable as such in an x-ray machine. See RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (32) for the complete definition.

**Are *undetectable firearms* legal?**

No, they are prohibited outright by RCW [9.41.190](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.190) part (1). This basically mirrors federal law in [18 U.S. Code § 922 (p)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922#p).

**Are polymer lowers and frames illegal then?**

In my opinion, no. I do not believe lowers, frames, or receivers are *firearms* under state definition RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (11) since they are not yet capable of firing a projectile. Therefore they can not yet be *undetectable firearms* either. However, a complete gun made from such a lower, frame, or receiver could become subject to those laws depending on how it's constructed. Generally this is avoided naturally by having enough metal bits in the barrel, bolt, and internals to become "detectable".

## Purchasing

**Is there a waiting period when purchasing firearms?**

For any firearm other than a *semiautomatic assault rifle*, RCW [9.41.092](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.092) part (1) requires a dealer to wait until either approval of all required background checks or ten business days have elapsed, whichever happens first, before delivering the firearm. For a *semiautomatic assault rifle*, part (2) requires a dealer to wait until ten business days have elapsed even if background checks are approved earlier.

**Even for CPL holders?**

Yes. In 2019 the legislature repealed the waiver for CPL holders to the waiting periods on pistol purchases. The waiver will return on July 1, 2022 if the new state centralized background check system isn't up and running by the end of 2021.

**Can someone under 21 purchase a pistol or semiautomatic rifle?**

No. RCW [9.41.240](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.240) part (1) prohibits a person under twenty-one from purchasing a *pistol* or *semiautomatic assault rifle*.

**What is the process for purchasing a semiautomatic rifle?**

* Proof of safety training completed within the last five years — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (2) (a)*
* A completed [firearm transfer application](https://www.dol.wa.gov/forms/652001.pdf) — *RCW [9.41.090](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.090) (6)*

* Up to ten business day wait or approval, whichever occurs first — *RCW [9.41.092](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.092) (1)*

## Private Sales and Transfers

**Are background checks required for private sales or transfers?**

Generally, yes. RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) requires most private transfers to go through a dealer who will transfer the gun to the recipient as though the dealer was selling it directly from their inventory. There are some exemptions, however, listed under part (4).

**Are sales to friends and relatives exempt from the background check requirements?**

No. See RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) part (4).

**Are gifts and loans to friends and relatives exempt from the background check requirements?**

*Bona fide* gifts and loans to immediate family are exempt by RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4) (a). In general, other gifts and loans are not except for the temporary situations listed in (4) (c), (d), and (g). However, because of federal interstate laws, beware that this exemption only applies if both persons are residents of Washington.

**Is a C&R transfer exempt from the background check requirements?**

Yes. See RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4) (i).

**Does sharing guns at the range require background checks?**

No. By RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) (4) (g), there are several exceptions that could apply here, including a temporary transfer that occurs at and never leaves an organized competition, a temporary transfer that remains in the presence of the original owner, and a temporary transfer to someone under 18 for sporting purposes while that person is supervised by an adult.

**Are there any other exemptions?**

Yes. For instance, a temporary transfer between spouses or a temporary transfer to prevent suicide or other imminent death or bodily harm. See RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) part (4) for the complete list of exemptions.

**Is a background check required when selling a lower, frame, or receiver?**

In my opinion, no. I do not believe a lower, frame, or receiver meets the definition of a *firearm* under state definition RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (11) and is therefore not subject to state *firearm* laws, including universal background checks. However I suggest consulting a lawyer before doing this. The distinction between federal and state law is not well understood by everyone.

## Frames and Receivers

**Do the *semiautomatic assault rifle* provisions of I-1639 apply to AR-15 lower receivers?**

No. A lower does not meet the state definition of a *rifle* or *semiautomatic assault rifle* in RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (23) and (26).

**Do the state requirements on *pistol* transfers apply to pistol frames?**

No. A pistol frame does not meet the state definition of a *pistol* in RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (22).

**Is an AR-15 lower receiver with attached stock considered a *rifle*?**

No. The ATF has specified that a lower is not a rifle until assembled with a barreled action. See [this article](https://www.typicalshooter.com/atf-putting-a-stock-on-an-ar-15-lower-does-not-make-it-a-rifle/) for more.

**Are upper receivers considered *firearms* subject to background check and transfer regulations?**

No. Upper receivers are unregulated by both federal and state law and may be shipped directly to your door.

**Aren't *frames and receivers* going to be subject to the state background check process similar to pistols soon?**

Yes. Starting 30 days after the state centralized system becomes available a dealer will be required to transfer a federally-defined *firearm frame or receiver* through the new state system in a manner similar to *pistols*.

## Curio & Relics

**Is a Curio & Relic purchase exempt from universal background checks?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.113](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.113) part (4)(i) exempts transfers of C&R firearms to someone who holds a valid C&R license. Federal law also exempts C&R transfers from the typical dealer background check process.

**Is a C&R-eligible semiautomatic rifle subject to the *semiautomatic assault rifle* provisions of I-1639**?

This is a complicated question with no definite answer. In my opinion, partially. See [this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/WA_guns/comments/ggq7zo/2020_wa_gun_law_faq_soliciting_questions/fq3x2wk/) for more discussion on this topic.

**Can a C&R holder purchase a C&R-eligible *semiautomatic assault rifle* from a dealer and walk away with it the same day?**

I don't have an official answer, but in my opinion no. See [this comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/r/WA_guns/comments/ggq7zo/2020_wa_gun_law_faq_soliciting_questions/fq3x2wk/) for more discussion on this topic.

## Residency

**What counts as residency for gun purchases?**

State law doesn't address this, but federal law considers the buyer a resident of whichever state they are currently residing in. Active-duty military members are considered a resident of whichever state their permanent duty station is located in, and college students are considered a resident of the state where they live and attend school during the school year, and of their home state when returning home for breaks. See [this ATF FAQ](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/qa/what-constitutes-residency-state) for more information on residency for gun purchases. Keep in mind this is different than residency for other purposes like taxation, voting, or in-state tuition rates. Those have different definitions.

## Out-of-state Purchases

**Can a Washington resident purchase guns over the internet from vendors in other states?**

Yes, however the gun must be delivered to a dealer in Washington first who will then process and deliver the firearm to the purchaser according to federal and state law.

**Can a Washington resident purchase guns in person in other states?**

Depending on the type of gun, yes. RCW [9.41.122](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.122) allows Washington residents to purchase a rifle or shotgun in another state. Under federal law, a resident of one state may purchase a rifle or shotgun in another state provided the sale complies with the "legal conditions of sale" in both states.

**Can a Washington resident purchase a *semiautomatic assault rifle* in another state**?

As a matter of academic legal discussion, possibly, there's room for interpretation and debate about state and federal law here. However, as a matter of practice, no. Federal law allows a resident of one state to purchase a rifle or shotgun from a dealer in another state provided the sale complies with the "legal conditions of sale" of both states. It is not clear if the "conditions of sale" means only the purchase eligibility requirements on the buyer or also the delivery requirements placed on the dealer. So many dealers in other states will not transfer a semiautomatic rifle to a Washington resident to avoid any potential risk.

## Purchases by Non-residents

**Can a resident of another state purchase guns in this state?**

Yes, but only shotguns or manual action rifles. RCW [9.41.124](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.124) specifically prohibits the sale of a *semiautomatic assault rifle* to a resident of another state, and federal law prohibits a dealer from selling any firearm other than a shotgun or a rifle to a resident of another state.

## Interstate Transfers

**How does a resident of another state legally transfer a firearm to a Washington resident?**

Federal law requires a dealer to facilitate a transfer between residents of different states. Generally this requires delivering the firearm to a dealer in the recipient's state before the recipient can take possession of it. However a rifle or shotgun can be transferred by a dealer in any state provided the firearm is legal and the transfer complies with laws of both the state of residence of the recipient and the state of business of the dealer. Note that the ATF has interpreted this to prohibit a dealer in another state from transferring a semiautomatic rifle to a resident of Washington, so those must go to a dealer in Washington first in all cases.

**Is there an exemption for gifts between immediate family who reside in different states?**

No. Federal law has no exemption to interstate transfer rules for gifts, even between family members.

## State Centralized Background Check System

**Isn't the process for purchasing firearms changing soon?**

Yes. In 2020 the legislature passed a bill authorizing the creation of a centralized state background check run by the Washington State Patrol in consultation with the DOL.

**When do dealers have to start using the new system?**

Thirty days after the WSP notifies dealers that the system is available. Currently the WSP and DOL are estimating the system will be ready in 2024.

**What will the sale or transfer process be in the new state system?**

Roughly the same as the current process for *pistols*. Dealers will no longer contact either local authorities or NICS directly for any transfer and will instead contact WSP directly for all firearm transfers. All transfers will have a fee up to $18 and a transfer application similar to what we currently have for *pistols* and *semiautomatic rifles*. The DOL will continue to keep records of *pistol* or *semiautomatic rifle* transfers, but will not retain records of other firearm transfers.

## Annual Background Checks

**Who is subject to the annual background checks?**

RCW [9.41.139](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.139) requires the DOL and WSP to conduct annual background checks on anyone who has acquired a *pistol* or *semiautomatic assault rifle* according to the rules of RCW chapter 9.41.

**When do the annual background checks start?**

RCW [9.41.139](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.139) requires the DOL and WSP to start performing these checks by July 1, 2020, but so far none have occurred. The DOL has decided to delay implementation of this until the new state centralized system is up and running.

**Does this apply to past purchases?**

We don't know. I-1639 did not specify which records are subject to the background check process. Since the DOL has retained pistol purchase records for decades, and private pistol transfer records for about 5 years, they have the data they need to apply this retroactively if required. Even the DOL themselves don't know. In their [report](https://www.dol.wa.gov/business/firearms/docs/FirearmsEligibilityReport2020.pdf) to the legislature on feasibility and costs, they provided two estimates: one for all records made since their current system was established in 2004, and one for all records made since the provision took effect on July 1, 2019.

**What are the guidelines for being placed on that list?**

There is nothing official that I know of yet, but I assume it includes anyone who's filled out a *pistol* or *semiautomatic rifle* transfer application since those are the records retrained by DOL.

**How is someone removed from the list?**

Unknown. I-1639 contained no provisions detailing if or when to take someone off the list.

**Does having a CPL make any difference regarding whether you are subjected to the yearly background check?**

No. A CPL is completely irrelevant to the annual background checks required in RCW [9.41.139](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.139).

## Health Information Waiver

**What is the health information waiver?**

RCW [9.41.094](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.094) provides that a signed application to purchase a *pistol* or *semiautomatic assault rifle* constitutes a waiver to release health information related to determining if the purchaser is eligible to possess firearms under state or federal law. RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.0070) (4) provides the same implied waiver for CPL applications.

**Is the health data waiver a violation of HIPAA?**

No. The waiver required by RCW [9.41.094](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.094) is not a HIPAA violation. HIPAA includes [many exemptions](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/505/what-does-the-privacy-rule-allow-covered-entities-to-disclose-to-law-enforcement-officials/index.html) where information can be released with or without your consent, including "*to report PHI to law enforcement when required by law to do so*".

In addition, RCW [9.41.097](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.097) compels health agencies to release information relevant to firearms eligibility to law enforcement agencies and courts regardless of whether or not you have signed a waiver.

## Moving to WA

**What guns and accessories can be brought into Washington during a move?**

The state currently only prohibits machine guns, short barreled shotguns, bump-stocks, and *undetectable firearms*. See above for more on *undetectable firearms*, but these have also been illegal under federal law since the 1980s so you most likely do not have one.

**Do guns needs to be registered after moving?**

No. Washington does not have an ownership registry. We have a *de facto* transfer registry for pistols and semiautomatic rifles, but no ownership registry, and there is no requirement to file any paperwork when moving with guns already possessed.

**How does someone establish residency for gun purchases in Washington?**

By moving here. As soon as you're here with an intent to make a home you are considered a resident for gun purposes. However, you will need some kind of government-issued document with your current address to establish proof of residency to satisfy federal law for gun purchases. Any government-issued document is legal, but many dealers choose to only accept a driver's license or state ID, so be sure to apply for a new driver's license as soon as possible.

**How long does a new resident have to wait before purchasing guns in Washington?**

There is no wait. You can begin purchasing guns in Washington as a resident as soon as you have proof of residency. However, beware that for residents who have been here less than 90 days, a dealer must wait up to 60 days before delivering a pistol instead of the normal ten business days. Though they can still deliver earlier if background checks are approved earlier. See RCW [9.41.092](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.092) for more.

## Open Carry

**Is open carry legal?**

Generally, yes, however there are some restrictions. As of this year, open carry is illegal at or within 250 feet of permitted demonstrations, on the west capitol campus, in any building on capitol campus, in legislative offices, and in any area currently holding a public legislative hearing or meeting. RCW online has not yet been updated with these new provisions, but you can read about them in the [full text](http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5038-S.SL.pdf) of the bill passed this year, SB 5038 (2021).

In addition, firearms are prohibited outright in specific locations. See the *Possession Restrictions by Location* section further down.

**Is a permit required to open carry?**

No. State law does not require any permits or require anything else to open carry.

**Is open carry in a vehicle legal?**

Only if you have a CPL. State law requires a CPL to possess a loaded firearm inside a vehicle, regardless of whether it is openly carried on your person or not.

## Concealed Carry

**Is concealed carry legal?**

For a pistol, yes, though you generally need a Concealed Pistol License.

**Is a CPL required to carry concealed at home?**

No. RCW [9.41.050](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050) specifically exempts concealed carry in a person's *"place of abode or fixed place of business"*.

**Is a CPL required to carry concealed while engaged in outdoor activities?**

No. RCW [9.41.060](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060) part (8) provides an exemption to the CPL requirement when a person is lawfully engaged in outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, or hiking.

## Concealed Pistol License

**When is a CPL required?**

 Except in your home or place of business and as otherwise excepted, a CPL is required to carry a pistol (whether loaded or not) concealed on your person. See RCW [9.41.050](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050) for more information and RCW [9.41.060](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060) for a list of exceptions.

**What is the process for obtaining a CPL?**

Generally, obtaining a CPL requires filling out an application, providing fingerprints, and paying a fee of $36 plus whatever the fingerprinting costs. See also RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) for the full CPL requirements and [this DOL information page](https://www.dol.wa.gov/business/firearms/faconcealreq.html) for a summary.

**How long does it take to get a CPL?**

By law the issuing authority must issue a CPL within 30 days, unless the applicant hasn't been a resident of the state for at least 90 days or doesn't have a state provided ID, in which case the issuing authority has 60 days to issue. See RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) (1).

**Is Washington a shall-issue state?**

Yes. An issuing authority must issue a CPL unless the applicant is prohibited by state or federal law from possessing firearms. See RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) (1), paragraph 2.

**Who is eligible for a CPL?**

Anyone who is at least 21 years old and not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law from possessing firearms. See RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) part (1) (a-g) for the list of disqualifying factors.

**Are non-residents eligible for a CPL?**

Yes. There is no distinction between a resident and non-resident CPL other than where a person applies and how long the issuing authority has to make a decision. Unless the person is prohibited, the issuing authority must issue the CPL within 30 days to a resident and within 60 days to a new resident or non-resident.

**Where do I apply for a CPL?**

Residents of any city or town may apply at either the police department of the municipality where they reside or the sheriff of the county where they reside. Residents of unincorporated counties may apply at the sheriff of the county where they reside. Non-residents may apply at any police department or sheriff office in the state. See RCW [9.41.070](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) part (13).

**How is COVID affecting CPLs?**

Unfortunately, many police and sheriff agencies have months-long backups for new original CPLs due to the fingerprinting requirements. Due to COVID, many agencies have severely limited the number of fingerprinting appointments available in a given week and some refuse to accept third-party fingerprinting services.

## Possession in Vehicles

**Is carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle legal?**

A person with a valid CPL may possess a loaded pistol in a vehicle. Otherwise placing or possessing a loaded pistol in any vehicle is illegal. See RCW [9.41.050](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050) part (2).

See also RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (17) for the state definition of *loaded*, but generally this means no ammunition in the chamber, cylinder, or in a magazine inserted in the action. It does not include loaded magazines which are removed from the firearm.

Long guns may not be loaded in a vehicle except for hunters granted a disability designation while hunting and otherwise in compliance with hunting regulations. See RCW [77.15.460](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.15.460). Note that in this specific case loaded detachable clips or magazines may not be attached to the rifle or shotgun, either.

**Does this apply to public transportation?**

In my opinion, yes. State law doesn't contain an exemption for public transportation in the laws prohibiting placing or possessing a loaded firearm in any vehicle. See RCW [9.41.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070) part (2).

**Are there any exemptions?**

Yes. See the exceptions listed in RCW [9.41.060](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060).

**Does state law require separating guns and ammo in a vehicle?**

No. State law only requires that guns are not loaded in a vehicle, except for pistols with a valid CPL. 

**Can an AR pistol be transported loaded in a vehicle with a valid CPL?**

In my opinion, yes, provided the firearm in question meets the definition of a *pistol* in RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) part (22). I do not know of any cases where this has been tested, however, and you should consult an attorney for clarification.

## Possession Restrictions by Location

**Are firearms prohibited in schools?**

Generally, yes, RCW [9.41.280](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.280) prohibits possession of any firearm on school grounds, in school facilities, in school transportation, or in other areas being used exclusively by schools. Part (3) (e) exempts CPL holders in possession of a pistol while picking up or dropping off a student. In addition, part (3) (f) exempts any person who is not a student and secures and conceals from view a firearm inside a vehicle.

**Are firearms prohibited in day care facilities?**

Effective June 11, 2020, yes. [SB 5434](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?year=2020&billnumber=5434&initiative=false) prohibits possession of any firearm on the grounds of day care facilities similar to how RCW [9.41.280](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.280) prohibits possession on school grounds. It also contains similar exemptions for CPL holders while dropping off or picking up children and for firearms secured and obscured within vehicles. This bill has not yet been codified into RCW on the state website, but I'll add the link here after it has.

**Are there any other locations where firearms are prohibited?**

Yes. RCW [9.41.300](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.300) part (1) prohibits possession of any firearm in other places, including jails; court rooms; mental health facilities; bars, lounges, and cannabis shops; airports; and others, though common entry areas are usually exempted.

RCW [9.41.300](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.300) part (2) (b) allows cities, towns, and counties to prohibit possession of a firearm inside a stadium or convention center operated by a city, town or county, but exempts CPL holders in possession of a pistol.

**Do gun free zones have force of law?**

Only for the situations mentioned above. Otherwise, no, but trespassing law still applies.

## Possession Restrictions by Age

**Can a person under 18 possess a firearm?**

Generally, no, but there are exceptions. RCW [9.41.040](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.040) (2) (a) (vi) prohibits possession of any firearm by someone under 18 except as provided in RCW [9.41.042](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.042).

**Can someone over 18 but under 21 possess a pistol?**

Yes, but with limitations. RCW [9.41.240](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.240) (2) restricts possession of a pistol by someone at least 18 but not yet 21 to their home, fixed place of business, or property under their control unless one of the exceptions in RCW [9.41.042](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.040), [9.41.050](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.050), or [9.41.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060) applies. These exceptions include situations like safety courses, target shooting, competition, hunting, on a parent or relative's private property, or while engaged in a lawful outdoor activity.

**Can someone over 18 but under 21 possess a *semiautomatic assault rifle*?**

Yes, but with limitations. RCW [9.41.240](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.240) (3) restricts possession of a *semiautomatic assault rifle* by someone at least 18 but not yet 21 to their home, fixed place of business, or property under their control unless one of the exceptions in RCW [9.41.042](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.040) or [9.41.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.060) applies. These exceptions include situations like safety courses, target shooting, competition, hunting, on a parent or relative's private property, or while engaged in a lawful outdoor activity.

## Secure Storage

**What qualifies as *secure gun storage*?**

In general, any locking box, safe, or other container should qualify. See RCW [9.41.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) (25) for the complete definition.

**Does state law require guns be stored in secure storage?**

Technically, no. However, RCW [9.41.360](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.360) can provide criminal penalties if a prohibited person actually gains access to guns and actually uses them to injure, kill, threaten, intimidate, or endanger others, or to commit additional crimes.

However, there are exceptions provided in part (3) that waive liability including when the guns were stored in *secure storage* or when the guns were taken as a result of unlawful entry, provided that the owner reports the theft within 5 days of discovering it.

**Does state law require reporting stolen guns?**

Again, technically, no. However not doing so may result in criminal charges under RCW [9.41.360](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.360). Specifically, the unlawful entry exemption in (3) (d) does not apply if the stolen guns are not reported within 5 days of discovering the theft.

## Using or Displaying Force

**What constitutes deadly force?**

RCW [9A.16.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.010) (2) defines deadly force.

**When is force justified?**

RCW [9A.16.020](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.020) specifies when force is justified. Parts (3) and (4) are likely the most common justifications for a private individual. Beware that part (3) only allows using force to prevent or resist injury or other offenses against you when the force is no more than necessary.

**When is deadly force justified?**

RCW [9A.16.050](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.16.050) specifies when lethal force is justified. Please read this statute yourself and consult a lawyer if you have any questions. Lethal force is a life changing event and carries significant legal and financial risks. Beware that even if you are not criminally charged, you may still be sued in civil court which has a lower burden of proof.

**What constitutes "brandishing"?**

Washington state has no crime named *brandishing*. However, there are two statutes that criminalize actions commonly referred to as "brandishing".

Under RCW [9.41.230](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.230) it is illegal to aim a firearm, loaded or not, at another human being and to wilfully discharge a firearm in a public place where others might be endangered.

Under RCW [9.41.270](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.270), except in a person's home or business or in lawful defense, it is illegal to carry, exhibit, display, or draw any deadly weapon in an intent to intimidate another or in a manner that warrants alarm for the safety of others.

The courts have generally interpreted that "warrants alarm" has a reasonableness requirement, meaning that any reasonable person would also be alarmed. This is important as it defends against frivolous claims. See [*State v. Maclolek* (1984)](https://law.justia.com/cases/washington/supreme-court/1984/49904-7-1.html), [*State v. Spencer* (1994)](http://courts.mrsc.org/appellate/075wnapp/075wnapp0118.htm), and [*State v. Owens* (2014)](https://law.justia.com/cases/washington/court-of-appeals-division-ii/2014/43702-3.html).

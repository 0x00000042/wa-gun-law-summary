With the passing of [HB 1705](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?year=2022&billnumber=1705) a few days ago, there's been a lot of questions about the effects of the bill. I will try my best to summarize what it means for us here in one thread. I'm no expert, so I can't guarantee accuracy, and I will update the post ad understanding changes.

If you have additional questions, feel free to ask them in the comments and I'll consider adding them to this post.

### Disclaimers

**Are you a lawyer?**

No.

**Can you provide legal advice?**

No.

**Will you defend me in court if I make mistakes?**

No.

### General

**Should I read the [full text](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1705-S.E.pdf) myself?**

Yes.

**What does this bill do?**

In summary, the bill prohibits firearms and "unfinished frames and receivers" that are not serialized by a dealer, manufacturer, or importer and provides requirements on how a dealer, manufacturer, or importer can serialize such items if they aren't already serialized.

**When does this bill take effect?**

July 1, 2022, though some provisions don't apply until March 10, 2023.

## "Untraceable Firearms"

**What is an "untraceable firearm"?**

Any *firearm* made after July 1, 2019 that does not have a serial number applied by a federally licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer. This definition has existed since 2019 in RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010), though this bill slightly modifies it to also include serial numbers applied by dealers rather than only manufacturers and importers.

**Are "untraceable firearms" now illegal?**

Section 4 of the bill specifically prohibits the following:

1. Manufacturing or assembling an "untraceable firearm" after July 1, 2022
2. Possessing, transporting, or receiving an "untraceable firearm" after March 10, 2023
3. Selling, offering to sell, transferring, or purchasing an "untraceable firearm" after July 1, 2022

**Does this apply to frames and receivers?**

In my opinion, no. I do not believe frames or receivers qualify for the state definition of *firearm* in RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010) so they could not then be an *untraceable firearm*. In addition, the bill separately defines both "frame or receiver" and "unfinished frame or receiver", which would be unnecessary if they were considered *firearms*. See the next section for more on "unfinished frame or receivers".

**Does this apply to antiques?**

No. The bill specifically exempts federally defined *antique firearms* from the prohibitions mentioned above. Note that this is an uncommon example where state law relies exclusively on a federal definition rather than its own state definitions in RCW [9.41.010](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.010).

**Does this apply to pre-1968 firearms that don't have serial numbers?**

No. The bill specifically exempts any firearm manufactured before 1968 from the prohibitions mentioned above.

## "Unfinished Frames and Receivers"

**What is an "unfinished frame or receiver"?**

The bill defines this as any "frame or receiver" that is "partially complete, disassembled, or inoperable" that either: (a) "may readily be completed, assembled, converted, or restored to a functional state"; or (b) "is marketed or sold... as the frame or receiver of a functional firearm once finished or completed, including without limitation... 80 percent frame or receiver"

**What is a "frame or receiver"?**

The bill defines this as any part of a firearm that is visible from the exterior and houses, holds, or integrates one or more "fire control components". It further explains that any such part that is identified with a serial number is presumed to be a "frame or receiver" unless the ATF officially determines otherwise.

**What is a "fire control component"?**

The bill defines this as any "component necessary for the firearm to initiate, complete, or continue the firing sequence" including things like the hammer, bolt, bolt carrier, cylinder, trigger, firing pin, striker, or slide rails.

**Then what is an "unfinished frame or receiver"?**

Putting all this together, an "unfinished frame or receiver" would be any part of a firearm that meets all of the following:

1. Visible from the exterior; and
2. Houses fire control components; and
3. Either:
    a. Is partially complete, disassembled, or inoperable; or
    b. Is marketed as an 80% or otherwise unfinished frame or receiver

**Are "unfinished frames or receivers" now illegal?**

Section 5 of the bill prohibits the following:

1. Possessing, transporting, or receiving an "unfinished frame or receiver" after March 10, 2023 unless it is serialized by a federally licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer.
2. Selling, offering to sell, transferring, or purchasing an "unfinished frame or receiver" after July 1, 2022 unless it is serialized by a federally licensed manufacturer, importer, or dealer.

**Does this apply to an AR upper, pistol slide, or revolver cylinder?**

Unknown. The text is not clear enough to say this for sure. We'll have to see how the courts interpret this, so proceed at your own risk. In my opinion, probably not unless there's actual manufacturing work remaining to finalize the part itself, but that's me reading between the lines.

## Serialization Requirements

**Who may serialize an "untraceable firearm" or "unfinished frame or receiver"?**

Section 6 of the bill authorizes any federally licensed dealer or other federal licensee authorized to provide marking services to provide serialization services.

**Can I serialize my "untraceable firearm" or "unfinished frame or receiver" myself?**

No, not unless you are a federally licensed dealer, manufacturer, or importer.

**Is there a specific serial number format?**

Yes. The bill requires the serial number to contain a prefix that is the FFL's abbreviated license number, followed by a hyphen, followed by a number unique to any other serial number applied by that FFL.

**Are there marking size and depth requirements?**

Yes. The bill requires the serial number to otherwise comply with the minimum size, and depth required by federal law when marking firearms.

**Must the serial number be applied to metal?**

In my opinion, yes. The bill requires the serial number to be applied in a way that resists modification or removal as required under federal law, and the ATF currently requires serial numbers to be applied to metal.

**Does the FFL need to record any information when serializing?**

Yes. The bill requires the dealer, manufacturer, or importer to "retain records that accord with the requirements under federal law in the case of the sale of a firearm".

**Does the FFL need to submit any information to the state?**

No. The bill does not require the dealer, manufacturer, or importer to transmit any information to the state.

## Penalties

**What are the penalties for violating this bill?**

The criminal penalties are as follows:

1. First violation - civil infraction and $500 fine
2. Second violation - misdemeanor (up to 90 days in jail, up to $1000 fine, or both)
3. Third or further violation - gross misdemeanor (up to 364 days in jail, up to $5000 fine, or both)
4. Three or more violations at the same time - immediate gross misdemeanor
